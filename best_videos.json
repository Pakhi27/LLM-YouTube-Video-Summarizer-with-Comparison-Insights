revolutionize every aspect of daily life work mobility medicine the economy and communication but will ai really make medicine better and doctors superfluous when will self-driving cars hit our roads will intelligent robots usurp our jobs and are we heading for a dystopia with no privacy and total surveillance what exactly is artificial intelligence and how much can it really do what will change and what will remain pure fantasy to answer these questions we embarked on an exciting journey to meet the scientists working on our future in the us britain germany and china [Music] our first stop silicon valley in california apple google and facebook all have their headquarters here it's the epicenter of the digital revolution the tech industry has changed the face of the san francisco bay area new startup companies launch every day rents have exploded and artificial intelligence is the buzzword a new type of supermarket recently opened its doors here amazon go all you need here is an app hold your mobile phone to the scanner and you're in [Music] as leonardo shows me amazon's new menus and explains that the language assistant alexa can help with the preparation at home i'm under constant surveillance which shelf do i stop at which products am i interested in on the ceiling sensors and cameras intelligent image recognition captures my every move what do i take off the shelf what do i put back and what do i take with me this branch is still in its test phase but amazon plans to open 50 such grocery stores this year alone the end of the sales assistant just walk out no more standing in line no cashiers i feel a bit like a shoplifter as i leave comfort at the cost of privacy my receipt one block away a robot cafe another test lab for the future order by app and touch screen the increasingly ubiquitous tools of trade my first ever cup of coffee served by a robot so this is the taste of the future ai will change our shopping experience but what will happen to employees stanford university is at the forefront of global ai research with an annual budget of 6.5 billion dollars [Music] i want to know how will artificial intelligence change medicine researchers here have developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that can screen x-rays for certain diseases computer scientist pranav rajpurkar shows me how easy it is to use take a picture of an x-ray with your mobile phone upload the image and a few seconds later you get the diagnosis it's a mass and it's saying this thing over here is a possibly cancerous lesion and i can see that right over here okay so it gives you if i may have a look at it now probabilities for pneumonia inaudible edema effusion and that goes bank yeah now how does this work i mean how did you get to the point we started with a large data set of chest x-rays which were released by the nih and these contained x-rays and then also labels of different pathologies and whether they existed in those x-rays so it might say okay here's an image and on this image i have pathology one two and three and we had hundred thousand of these images [Music] so we trained a model that can take in it as an input and x-ray and then output the probability of several different pathologies on this x-ray artificial intelligence is modeled on the human brain a gigantic network of almost 100 billion interconnected neurons put in very simple terms this is how a brain cell works incoming impulses are passed in a domino effect from one neuron to the next the resulting circuit connects the neurons and it is this circuit that artificial intelligence tries to simulate as a digital neural network like our brains the network can learn how to identify tuberculosis for instance first the network needs to be trained or taught x-rays of tuberculosis patients are fed to the system initially it struggles to correctly identify the condition but every time an x-ray is fed in the network's structure is adapted and its diagnostic ability improves it takes thousands and thousands of clinical data sets to train the machine only after the network is optimized in this way can it correctly identify an unknown x-ray [Music] but how accurate is artificial intelligence compared to a doctor's expertise we have actually done this test twice at this point once with a set of studies from the nih data set that we had a group of radiologists label and then we compared the accuracy of the model to the radiologist and we found that they were very similar in terms of accuracy on most pathologies on one of them the model was outperforming the radiologists and on three of them the radiologists were outperforming the model and then we repeated the experiment this time using a data set from stanford which we recently released which is 200 thousand chest x-rays and then we had a similar setup where we had three sub-specialty radiologists these are very uncommon very trained radiologists to decide what the ground truth for a particular set of images was and then we compared general radiologists to the algorithm at the task and found that they had similar levels of performance so these are all stanford radiologists so so they're they're trained they should be good yeah [Music] reading x-rays accurately is a complicated process but artificial intelligence is making fast progress when it comes to identifying or recognizing simple images computers have surpassed human accuracy now if i look at your picture it's always probability so there are cases where the machine is not really sure what what would be sort of a clear decision to say okay this is i don't know pneumonia or something else yeah i think i mean i think it's good to talk in terms of probabilities because probabilities also give a sense of the algorithm the model's uncertainty on that particular problem i think one difficulty with probabilities is that it does make it hard for humans to interpret like what is the probability of 88 versus 92 percent mean in terms of the decision i should make in the clinic and so i think in that sense one of the things that we could experiment with doing in the future is rather than showing probabilities that are so fine-grained maybe we can show things like unlikely or this pathology is likely or this pathology is possible in healthcare artificial intelligence is powering a revolution scientists are using artificial intelligence algorithms to sift through seemingly banal data such as the up and down motion of the steps we take every day they're looking for conspicuous patterns that could serve as early warning signs of disease scientists in the english city of birmingham are working on a revolutionary diagnostic method to date there are no specific tests to detect parkinson's disease making diagnosis difficult ai could change that max little is a mathematician at aston university [Music] very good voice changes can be an early indicator of parkinson's max and his team collected thousands of vocal recordings and fed them to an algorithm they developed which learned to detect differences in voice patterns between people with and without the condition in a lab-based study of the recordings the algorithm was able to correctly identify a parkinson's diagnosis nearly 99 of the time max little's work is an example of the far-reaching changes ai is bringing to the field of medicine it's no longer just doctors who are using artificial intelligence to develop new diagnostic methods but data scientists programmers and mathematicians like max [Music] one example when a person walks sensors in their smartphone register the up and down motion of their gate [Music] but what information can be gleaned from such data if we measured a pattern of someone's walking behavior then someone who's healthy might have we might measure the accelerometer to look like that okay so it's just the sort of movement he would have here yeah the hips going up and down regularly that kind of thing along with their pace but if you looked at somebody with parkinson's disease they may have these small steps like this and they may be irregular or they may have patterns like that or they may even freeze and stop like that so you you can see that there's you know there's a difference there's a difference so you can also now train an algorithm for instance to pick out features like what is the the distance between the time distance between these uh these peaks and it could also do the same with this and it would be able to do that very precisely and by doing so we may be able to measure for instance that here that there's large variability in between these um the advantage of the algorithm really comes when the for instance you might have somebody who who is say who measures a pattern which looks like this and there might just be one small change perhaps that that occurs very very um maybe not like that but sort of you know some uh more variation that's right in the in the sequence of these um in the timing of these these events um even to a professional eye because they don't have the level of precision they may not be able to detect that this is outside of so the normal range of um a variation but of course an algorithm connected to a high precision sensor um we'll you know we'll be able to determine that difference and in this case this person here may in fact have um a precursor symptom of the disease so this would mean that this person with the help of an algorithm could be diagnosed as having parkinson whereas the doctor himself would miss him out that could for the first time make it possible to detect precursor symptoms of parkinson's and enable early intervention but what else does the data on our smartphones reveal right now you have already apps tracking your so-called activity yeah so in fact the data might be already there well the data potentially could be there that's right but there are ethics about whether we collect that kind of data and use it for for these sorts of purposes you know clearly we can't just collect this data and start diagnosing people which sure we should not no absolutely we could but we we really wouldn't want to there are very good reasons not to do it and uh there may be good reasons for doing it as well but that's the kind of thing that needs that needs to be worked through in a uh in a proper you know regulated setting [Music] after our interview max little tells me he's received several lucrative offers to join tech giants who smell new business opportunities he turned them down artificial intelligence will undoubtedly improve doctors abilities to detect and diagnose disease but amid all the opportunities ai offers there's an urgent need for regulation we're on our way to china a country that has experienced breathtaking change in recent years [Music] its capital beijing is buzzing the whole country is hungry for progress and is on a fast track to the future [Music] time seems to move faster here by the year 2030 china aims to be the global leader in the field of artificial intelligence and there's a lot to indicate it will meet that goal because the government has bankrolled subsidy programs worth billions of euros [Music] these robots aren't assembling cars they're the big attraction in beijing's latest smart restaurant ai in the kitchen and automated waiters i have a meeting here with the design researcher geisha yost a former internet ambassador for the german government she's currently spending a research semester at tongji university in shanghai i asked her about her impressions of china [Music] there's this real hunger in the city and it's super fun to talk to young people because they want to be the motors of change they work day and night they have a new work-life balance model it's called 996. i thought what do you mean 996. and they said we work from 9am to 9pm six days a week that's the better model now because they used to just work non-stop but no one's stopping no one's hitting the brakes they work like crazy because they want to bring about change as a this restaurant cost 20 million dollars just the one restaurant they've invested this huge sum to digitize the entire operation they aren't just robots serving the food the whole kitchen is digitized refrigeration is monitored supply chains are monitored there are dashboards for everything everything is connected here where they're testing what works and which aspects can be implemented in other restaurants of this chain that's the idea here to just try things and to think big [Music] think [Music] but what about privacy there seem to be a trade-off between security and privacy you often hear how ai has increased public safety for instance that the ubiquitous surveillance cameras have dramatically increased the crime solving rate it's hard for us to relate to because privacy and personal rights are so important for germans but here there's a different tradition and take on the issue i'm fascinated by china but it also puzzles me how can they be reconciled the high civilization of ancient china and the modern industrial state with surveillance cameras everywhere [Music] the long gan district in shenzhen in the heart of china's booming economic region north of hong kong we visit the smart city control center a giant monitor displays the data of the entire district in real time numbers of new residents by neighborhood to plan schools water supply levels power outages all this information is collected compiled and evaluated using artificial intelligence the showcase project was developed with chinese tech giant huawei chief engineer chen bangtai tells me the city now operates more efficiently so what you're doing here is urban planning yes the systems are a big help these are hospital beds right now there are 15 000 doctors and nurses and 7 600 beds so is shenzhen currently healthy or sick [Music] a smart surveillance system scans the entire city illegal structures like this one on a roof are quickly identified and demolished to me some of this feels like the backdrop to a science fiction movie employees with live streaming body cams inspect side streets this is total surveillance chan shows me how cameras installed in restaurant kitchens even keep tabs on cleanliness but doesn't the chef mind being monitored all the time chen says residents of long gang district approve jaywalking is not allowed and offenders are immediately identified look here you jaywalk once and right away your social credit score drops this degree of surveillance is unthinkable in the west but here in china they take a different view and say it's driven a drop in crime what does it say here male youth without glasses youth yes suddenly you're a youth [Music] a transparent society in the interest of efficiency some of this appears useful but do we really want to measure control and analyze everything just because it's technically possible won't that inevitably lead us down a road to data dictatorship maybe trust is better than smart control [Music] silicon valley a synonym for innovation and unlimited freedom the biggest players in the field of ai are based here but their headquarters are hidden behind inconspicuous low-rise buildings facebook we use their services entrust them with our data but the company is impervious to the public a selfie at the entrance gate is just about tolerated [Music] next door at apple the visitor center's 3d model of the campus is as close as non-employees can get to the new building what's going on inside [Music] it's all confidential [Music] we want to visit google here in california and requested an interview weeks before our arrival but all we get are stalling tactics like these visitors google leaves us out in the cold apart from a small store this is the only visitor highlight accessible to the public these android lawn statues are even a designated location on google maps [Applause] welcome to google google [Music] the european union handing google a 2.7 billion dollar anti-trust fine these companies command growing power over our daily lives and growing political influence google spends more than 6 million euros a year lobbying brussels alone the eu's transparency register lists more than 200 meetings with google representatives since 2014. google is the busiest lobbyist in brussels [Music] we finally get our interview not in california but in munich germany with one of the longest serving employees jens redma how important is ai for google ai is so important to us that two years ago we rebranded our entire research division to google ai ai drives a significant part of our product development ai above all drives a significant part of our efforts to improve the quality of our products take machine translation through the use of machine algorithms we've seen faster progress over the last two years than we did over the entire previous decade society will undoubtedly be propelled forward by the implementation of these services and the use of ai in the years to come what's key is that it's done responsibly under the principles of transparency we need to explain how things work why they are needed where people's data goes how they can control it how they can delete it if they want to delete it or forward it the user must have control but what about technologies like google home the smart microphone sitting in people's living rooms google home isn't eavesdropping there's a small chip on the device that listens out for the so-called hot word it's waiting for the command ok google or hey google and only then is the microphone switched on to send a voice command or search request to the internet the google server it then presents the results so as a science reporter i'm naturally curious about the future there's this patent application from september 2016. google's application gives a detailed account of what can be deduced from household noises how long we brush our teeth whether we argue or whether a housemate is ill it's much more about capturing atmosphere and habits than words and it's a google patent application that anyone can look up i don't know anything about this particular patent application we have a whole series of patent applications every year most of them are imaginary fictitious services which like in many other companies are never translated into real services [Music] services google's eu lobbying activities at least are unarguably real [Music] how much does google intervene in the eu i think the more important question is the one that lies between the lines namely how ethically does a company deal with product development and we have set our own rules according to principles that guide our own actions research and product development that also guides our business decisions on its home turf in the united states google is facing mounting political pressure in washington we meet barry lynn head of the think tank open market institute he warns of the dangers posed by tech giants influence we need to know in our society that the people who bring information to the public sphere who talk to the press who talk to the rep our representatives uh in congress that they represent their own selves that they're speaking in their own name and not for someone else that they're not stooges that they're not puppets and the fact is today our society this is true here in washington is true in europe our society is filled with puppets with stooges who represent the interests of google and facebook and amazon given big tech's monopoly power calls for regulation are growing louder in washington when you have a monopoly whether it's over retail whether it's over search then it means that the the public doesn't actually have the ability to understand how that information is being used how that power is being used monopoly per se unless it is regulated closely by the public is a danger google means to take over the world they mean to direct our thoughts between person and person our communications between person and person our dealings and business between person and corporation they mean to direct everything that they can they want to know what's going on in our thermostats and our houses they want to know what we're watching on tv they are at a level of hubris that even the the stalinists could never have imagined uh uh pushing for google facebook amazon will the influence of tech giants continue to grow what can be done to rein in their monopolies one thing is clear artificial intelligence is consolidating their grip on power there's an urgent need to rethink anti-trust policy [Music] mobility is another area in which ai is powering the march of innovation in the near future it could put self-driving cars on city roads but how realistic is this vision we've come to boston to the prestigious massachusetts institute of technology certus caraman is a leading expert in the field of self-driving cars he and his team are working on prototype autonomous vehicles i think that we've nailed a couple items with computers and machines one is all of this mapping and localization all that technology works super well computers can know where they are within centimeter maybe sometimes with a millimeter precision way more than what is required to drive computers are not able to look around and understand where everybody else's but that's not that's not what's required for driving what's really required is to understand what's going to happen next in the next three seconds five seconds next minutes maybe even sometimes next hour and so that's the key missing piece and i think the problem there is that right now it's very hard for you to describe to me how you understand whether or not a person is going to use the sidewalk or is going to use the crosswalk and cross the street sometimes you look at the face of a person and that facial impression gives them away and you will slow down sometimes not they may be looking at the same direction they may be standing in the same location it's just a little face impression maybe just the way they stand and unfortunately that kind of intuition gut feeling and so on is very hard for us to program into the computers [Music] it works in a simple lab environment but in real life settings the algorithms are still totally out of their depth not that that bothers advertisers our test drives were nothing but a series of glitches an inexplicable emergency stop and another one on the second attempt the sensors on this vehicle were over taxed by a car parked on the curb and here this smart car overlooked a car veering into our lane well that didn't work talking to the mit engineers it becomes clear that to build a self-driving car developers need to meet a massive scale of technical requirements what i think about fully autonomous cars is that i think i would be very surprised if it happens in less than 10 years also i will be very surprised i'm a big believer i'd be very surprised if it doesn't happen in 20 30 years i think it will happen at some point but i do think that people really underestimate the kind of technology required to be built to make your car fully autonomous under every condition every circumstance every whatsoever that's the very hard part [Music] [Applause] ultra fun driving is not as trivial a process as you might think and that's because you constantly have to watch what's going on around you cyclists pedestrians sometimes you have to second guess does this guy want to cross the road or not it's hard to imagine all that being calculated automatically [Music] [Music] a self-driving vehicle would have to be able to deal with all of this too here we have a truck doing a three-point turn i may have to back up now if he doesn't make it [Music] does she want to cross the road or not some people don't even wait [Music] the fully autonomous car is a distant dream but driver assistance systems are already making our roads safer an accident filmed from a car equipped with emergency brake assist the sequence of events can be assessed in slow motion the red vehicle ahead overlooks the upcoming traffic jam no brake lights appear but the distance sensor in this car registers the jam breaks and prevents a further collision but which principles should guide decisions made by technology in an accident situation in recent years mit's media lab has been addressing the ethical questions raised by artificial intelligence what moral compass should future smart devices refer to [Music] is one of the world's leading experts on such issues he and his team developed a survey called the moral machine to explore ethics for programming autonomous vehicles like in the event of an accident most of the time people don't remember anything and people have no time to react everything happens very quickly so they just are surprised maybe they see something in front of them and they just swerve in some random direction or maybe they just freak out and press the brakes so you cannot expect a human being to do the right thing in that small exactly in that in such a small time scale unless you know they they made a decision beforehand like you know did they drink and drive or did they know that they were going to cross a red light then you blame them but otherwise you can't really blame the human but with a machine because of the speed of the electronics because the autonomous car is evaluating the environment you know millions of times per second then time goes much slower for the machine and it's able to recalculate the situation and maybe recalculate the strategy and this is where we can make a potentially better judgment than the whatever random choice the human used to make in this situation now what is better though is a very interesting question and it's not obvious and let's see a case where we have people versus people so now we have um the vehicle has two people inside of it okay and um it's going to either swerve and hit the barrier so the people will die in the car or the car will go straight and kill the pedestrians the pedestrians who are crossing illegally but they're also women and and these uh the people in the car are males so now it gets very complicated very quickly should you prioritize women over men or should everybody be the same should you prioritize pedestrian over passenger or not should you take into account the fact that people are crossing illegally in this case so as you can see once you have multiple dimensions it becomes not obvious what the right thing to do is a or b who should die the elderly lady crossing on red or the child in the self-driving car what choice should the algorithm make ead's online survey presents respondents with various scenarios each with its own unique dilemma respondents are then asked to choose how they would want an algorithm to decide so as a result we have 40 million decisions and they're still counting from people all over the world and it enables us to start analyzing what do people agree on but also how do they differ [Music] so does our culture influence our moral judgments people always agree on saving more lives saving children saving people who cross legally over people who don't cross legally and so on the most interesting part is you could pick a country like germany yes and you could see how they compared to the global average you could see ah okay so the status is not really important but what you can see in germany is preferring in action yeah so if you don't have to if you prefer to just go straight yes which is the default don't take a decision exactly this means germans don't like to take a decision yes germans don't like other people you say close your eyes and and go and just go so so this means in other words you can see a bit the acceptance of technology taking a decision and the more you say inaction means a comparison of germany and france reveals cultural differences the french tend to favor sparing women and there's a stronger focus on children and contrary to germans the french don't want to leave things to fate they want the machine to make the decision the machine is kind of a mirror for the first time something that you did subconsciously or maybe instinctively in the case of an accident you know you just act randomly now you have to make a conscious choice and the machine is forcing you to make a choice right you cannot you cannot hand wave it because in the end you have to program something driverless cars aren't yet ready for the road and ethical questions still abound artificial intelligence harbors immense potential to benefit daily life medicine or mobility but we also need to look beyond the technical possibilities what aim does such progress serve it's a question artificial intelligence algorithms can't answer only humankind can do that [Music] you",

        "Topic": "Machine Learning",
        "Video_ID": "9gGnTQTYNaE",
        "Transcript": "Hey, what's up everyone? My name is Luv Aggarwal, and I\u2019m a Data\nPlatform Solution engineer for IBM.  Machine Learning. There's no doubt that this is an incredibly\nhot topic with significant interest from both business professionals as well as technologists.\nSo let's talk about what machine learning, or ML, is. So, before we get too far into the details,\nI want to take a minute to talk about some terms that are often used interchangeably\nbut have certain differences. Terms like \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d,\n\u201cmachine learning\u201d, and even \u201cdeep learning\u201d. So, at the highest level, AI is defined as\nleveraging computers or machines to mimic the problem-solving and the decision-making\ncapabilities of the human mind.  And machine learning is a subset within AI that's more\nfocused on the use of various self-learning algorithms that derive knowledge from data\nin order to predict outcomes. And then, finally, deep learning is a further\nsubset within even machine learning, and deep learning is often thought of as scalable machine\nlearning because it automates a lot of the feature extraction process away and eliminates\nthe some of the human intervention involved to enable the use of some really, really big\ndata sets. But for today we'll focus just on machine\nlearning, so we'll get rid of the other two and dive one level deeper and talk about the\ndifferent types of machine learning. Ok. So, the first type that we have is called\n\u201csupervised learning\u201d.  And this is when we use labeled data sets to train algorithms\nto classify data or predict outcomes. And when I say labeled, I mean that the rows\nin the data set are labeled, tagged, or classified in some interesting way that tells us something\nabout that data. So, it could be a yes or a no, or it could\nbe a particular category of some, you know, different attribute. OK, so how do we apply supervised machine\nlearning techniques? Well, this really depends on your particular\nuse-case. We could be using a classification model  which recognizes and groups ideas or objects into predefined categories. An example of this in the real world is with\ncustomer retention. So, if you're in the business of managing\ncustomers, one of your goals is typically minimizing and identifying customer churn,\nright, which are customers that no longer buy a particular product or service, and we\nwant to avoid churn because it's almost always more costly to acquire a new customer than\nit is to retain an existing one, right? So, if we have historical data for the customer,\nlike their activity - whether they churned or not, right - we can build a classification\nmodel using supervised machine learning, and our labeled data set that will help us identify\ncustomers that are about to churn, and then allow us to take action to retain them. OK, so the other type of supervised learning\nis regression. Now, this is when we build an equation using\nvarious input values with their specific weights determined by the overall value of their impact\non the outcome. And we use these to generate an estimate for\nan output value. So, let me give you another example here. So, airlines rely heavily on machine learning,\nand they use regression techniques to accurately predict how much they should be charging for\na particular flight, right? So, they use various input factors like, you\nknow, days before departure, the day of the week, the departure, the destination to use\nthese to predict an accurate dollar value for how much they should be charging for a\nspecific flight that will maximize their revenue. OK, so now let's move on to the second type\nof machine learning which is  \u201cunsupervised learning\u201d. OK, so this is when we use machine learning\nalgorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets, and this method helps us discover\nhidden patterns or groupings without the need for human intervention, right? So, we're using unlabeled data here. So, again, let's talk about the different\ntechniques for unsupervised learning. One method is \u201cclustering\u201d.  And a real-world\nexample of this is when organizations try to do  customer segmentation. Right.  So, when businesses try to do effective marketing\nit's really critical that they really understand who their customers are, right, so that they\ncan connect with them in the most relevant way. And, oftentimes, it's not obvious or clear\nhow certain customers are similar to or different from one another, right, and clustering algorithms\ncan help take into account a variety of information on the customer like their purchase history, you know, their social media activity, or website activity,  could be their geography, and much more, to group similar customers into buckets so that we can send them more\nrelevant offers, provide them better customer service, and be more targeted with our marketing\nefforts. Ok. And the last point I want to touch on\nfor unsupervised learning is called \u201cdimensionality reduction\u201d. So, we won't discuss this in detail in this\nvideo, but this refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a\ndata set so we don't let some redundant parameters over represent the impact on the on the outcome. Ok. So the last type of machine learning I\nwant to talk about today is called \u201creinforcement learning\u201d. Now, this is a form of semi-supervised learning\nwhere we typically have an agent or system take actions  in an environment. Now the environment will then either reward\nthe agent for correct moves,  or punish it for incorrect moves. Right. And, through many iterations of this, we can\nteach a system a particular task. Now a great example of this method in the\nreal world is with self-driving cars. So, autonomous driving has several factors,\nright? There's the speed limit, there are drivable\nzones, there are collisions, and so on. So, we can use forms of reinforcement learning\nto teach a system how to drive by avoiding collisions, following the speed limit, and\nso on. OK, so we covered many topics today, but you know,  we've barely scratched the surface of each one. If you found any one particular aspect of\nmachine learning interesting, I encourage you to dive deeper and learn more about it.\nAnd if you want to know what are some of the common machine learning algorithms and how\nto leverage them in data science, please check out some of the links in the description.

        "Transcript": "Last video I laid out the structure of a neural network. I'll give a quick recap here so that it's fresh in our minds, and then I have two main goals for this video. The first is to introduce the idea of gradient descent, which underlies not only how neural networks learn, but how a lot of other machine learning works as well. Then after that we'll dig in a little more into how this particular network performs, and what those hidden layers of neurons end up looking for. As a reminder, our goal here is the classic example of handwritten digit recognition, the hello world of neural networks. These digits are rendered on a 28x28 pixel grid, each pixel with some grayscale value between 0 and 1. Those are what determine the activations of 784 neurons in the input layer of the network. And then the activation for each neuron in the following layers is based on a weighted sum of all the activations in the previous layer, plus some special number called a bias. Then you compose that sum with some other function, like the sigmoid squishification, or a relu, the way I walked through last video. In total, given the somewhat arbitrary choice of two hidden layers with 16 neurons each, the network has about 13,000 weights and biases that we can adjust, and it's these values that determine what exactly the network actually does. Then what we mean when we say that this network classifies a given digit is that the brightest of those 10 neurons in the final layer corresponds to that digit. And remember, the motivation we had in mind here for the layered structure was that maybe the second layer could pick up on the edges, and the third layer might pick up on patterns like loops and lines, and the last one could just piece together those patterns to recognize digits. So here, we learn how the network learns. What we want is an algorithm where you can show this network a whole bunch of training data, which comes in the form of a bunch of different images of handwritten digits, along with labels for what they're supposed to be, and it'll adjust those 13,000 weights and biases so as to improve its performance on the training data. Hopefully, this layered structure will mean that what it learns generalizes to images beyond that training data. The way we test that is that after you train the network, you show it more labeled data that it's never seen before, and you see how accurately it classifies those new images. Fortunately for us, and what makes this such a common example to start with, is that the good people behind the MNIST database have put together a collection of tens of thousands of handwritten digit images, each one labeled with the numbers they're supposed to be. And as provocative as it is to describe a machine as learning, once you see how it works, it feels a lot less like some crazy sci-fi premise, and a lot more like a calculus exercise. I mean, basically it comes down to finding the minimum of a certain function. Remember, conceptually, we're thinking of each neuron as being connected to all the neurons in the previous layer, and the weights in the weighted sum defining its activation are kind of like the strengths of those connections, and the bias is some indication of whether that neuron tends to be active or inactive. And to start things off, we're just going to initialize all of those weights and biases totally randomly. Needless to say, this network is going to perform pretty horribly on a given training example, since it's just doing something random. For example, you feed in this image of a 3, and the output layer just looks like a mess. So what you do is define a cost function, a way of telling the computer, no, bad computer, that output should have activations which are 0 for most neurons, but 1 for this neuron, what you gave me is utter trash. To say that a little more mathematically, you add up the squares of the differences between each of those trash output activations and the value you want them to have, and this is what we'll call the cost of a single training example. Notice this sum is small when the network confidently classifies the image correctly, but it's large when the network seems like it doesn't know what it's doing. So then what you do is consider the average cost over all of the tens of thousands of training examples at your disposal. This average cost is our measure for how lousy the network is, and how bad the computer should feel. And that's a complicated thing. Remember how the network itself was basically a function, one that takes in 784 numbers as inputs, the pixel values, and spits out 10 numbers as its output, and in a sense it's parameterized by all these weights and biases? Well the cost function is a layer of complexity on top of that. It takes as its input those 13,000 or so weights and biases, and spits out a single number describing how bad those weights and biases are, and the way it's defined depends on the network's behavior over all the tens of thousands of pieces of training data. That's a lot to think about. But just telling the computer what a crappy job it's doing isn't very helpful. You want to tell it how to change those weights and biases so that it gets better. To make it easier, rather than struggling to imagine a function with 13,000 inputs, just imagine a simple function that has one number as an input and one number as an output. How do you find an input that minimizes the value of this function? Calculus students will know that you can sometimes figure out that minimum explicitly, but that's not always feasible for really complicated functions, certainly not in the 13,000 input version of this situation for our crazy complicated neural network cost function. A more flexible tactic is to start at any input, and figure out which direction you should step to make that output lower. Specifically, if you can figure out the slope of the function where you are, then shift to the left if that slope is positive, and shift the input to the right if that slope is negative. If you do this repeatedly, at each point checking the new slope and taking the appropriate step, you're going to approach some local minimum of the function. The image you might have in mind here is a ball rolling down a hill. Notice, even for this really simplified single input function, there are many possible valleys that you might land in, depending on which random input you start at, and there's no guarantee that the local minimum you land in is going to be the smallest possible value of the cost function. That will carry over to our neural network case as well. And I also want you to notice how if you make your step sizes proportional to the slope, then when the slope is flattening out towards the minimum, your steps get smaller and smaller, and that kind of helps you from overshooting. Bumping up the complexity a bit, imagine instead a function with two inputs and one output. You might think of the input space as the xy-plane, and the cost function as being graphed as a surface above it. Now instead of asking about the slope of the function, you have to ask which direction you should step in this input space so as to decrease the output of the function most quickly. In other words, what's the downhill direction? Again, it's helpful to think of a ball rolling down that hill. Those of you familiar with multivariable calculus will know that the gradient of a function gives you the direction of steepest ascent, which direction should you step to increase the function most quickly. Naturally enough, taking the negative of that gradient gives you the direction to step that decreases the function most quickly. Even more than that, the length of this gradient vector is an indication for just how steep that steepest slope is. If you're unfamiliar with multivariable calculus and want to learn more, check out some of the work I did for Khan Academy on the topic. Honestly though, all that matters for you and me right now is that in principle there exists a way to compute this vector, this vector that tells you what the downhill direction is and how steep it is. You'll be okay if that's all you know and you're not rock solid on the details. Cause If you can get that, the algorithm for minimizing the function is to compute this gradient direction, then take a small step downhill, and repeat that over and over. It's the same basic idea for a function that has 13,000 inputs instead of 2 inputs. Imagine organizing all 13,000 weights and biases of our network into a giant column vector. The negative gradient of the cost function is just a vector, it's some direction inside this insanely huge input space that tells you which nudges to all of those numbers is going to cause the most rapid decrease to the cost function. And of course, with our specially designed cost function, changing the weights and biases to decrease it means making the output of the network on each piece of training data look less like a random array of 10 values, and more like an actual decision we want it to make. It's important to remember, this cost function involves an average over all of the training data, so if you minimize it, it means it's a better performance on all of those samples. The algorithm for computing this gradient efficiently, which is effectively the heart of how a neural network learns, is called backpropagation, and it's what I'm going to be talking about next video. There, I really want to take the time to walk through what exactly happens to each weight and bias for a given piece of training data, trying to give an intuitive feel for what's happening beyond the pile of relevant calculus and formulas. Right here, right now, the main thing I want you to know, independent of implementation details, is that what we mean when we talk about a network learning is that it's just minimizing a cost function. And notice, one consequence of that is that it's important for this cost function to have a nice smooth output, so that we can find a local minimum by taking little steps downhill. This is why, by the way, artificial neurons have continuously ranging activations, rather than simply being active or inactive in a binary way, the way biological neurons are. This process of repeatedly nudging an input of a function by some multiple of the negative gradient is called gradient descent. It's a way to converge towards some local minimum of a cost function, basically a valley in this graph. I'm still showing the picture of a function with two inputs, of course, because nudges in a 13,000 dimensional input space are a little hard to wrap your mind around, but there is a nice non-spatial way to think about this. Each component of the negative gradient tells us two things. The sign, of course, tells us whether the corresponding component of the input vector should be nudged up or down. But importantly, the relative magnitudes of all these components kind of tells you which changes matter more. You see, in our network, an adjustment to one of the weights might have a much greater impact on the cost function than the adjustment to some other weight. Some of these connections just matter more for our training data. So a way you can think about this gradient vector of our mind-warpingly massive cost function is that it encodes the relative importance of each weight and bias, that is, which of these changes is going to carry the most bang for your buck. This really is just another way of thinking about direction. To take a simpler example, if you have some function with two variables as an input, and you compute that its gradient at some particular point comes out as 3,1, then on the one hand you can interpret that as saying that when you're standing at that input, moving along this direction increases the function most quickly, that when you graph the function above the plane of input points, that vector is what's giving you the straight uphill direction. But another way to read that is to say that changes to this first variable have 3 times the importance as changes to the second variable, that at least in the neighborhood of the relevant input, nudging the x-value carries a lot more bang for your buck. Let's zoom out and sum up where we are so far. The network itself is this function with 784 inputs and 10 outputs, defined in terms of all these weighted sums. The cost function is a layer of complexity on top of that. It takes the 13,000 weights and biases as inputs and spits out a single measure of lousiness based on the training examples. And the gradient of the cost function is one more layer of complexity still. It tells us what nudges to all these weights and biases cause the fastest change to the value of the cost function, which you might interpret as saying which changes to which weights matter the most. So, when you initialize the network with random weights and biases, and adjust them many times based on this gradient descent process, how well does it actually perform on images it's never seen before? The one I've described here, with the two hidden layers of 16 neurons each, chosen mostly for aesthetic reasons, is not bad, classifying about 96% of the new images it sees correctly. And honestly, if you look at some of the examples it messes up on, you feel compelled to cut it a little slack. Now if you play around with the hidden layer structure and make a couple tweaks, you can get this up to 98%. And that's pretty good! It's not the best, you can certainly get better performance by getting more sophisticated than this plain vanilla network, but given how daunting the initial task is, I think there's something incredible about any network doing this well on images it's never seen before, given that we never specifically told it what patterns to look for. Originally, the way I motivated this structure was by describing a hope we might have, that the second layer might pick up on little edges, that the third layer would piece together those edges to recognize loops and longer lines, and that those might be pieced together to recognize digits. So is this what our network is actually doing? Well, for this one at least, not at all. Remember how last video we looked at how the weights of the connections from all the neurons in the first layer to a given neuron in the second layer can be visualized as a given pixel pattern that the second layer neuron is picking up on? Well, when we actually do that for the weights associated with these transitions, from the first layer to the next, instead of picking up on isolated little edges here and there, they look, well, almost random, just with some very loose patterns in the middle there. It would seem that in the unfathomably large 13,000 dimensional space of possible weights and biases, our network found itself a happy little local minimum that, despite successfully classifying most images, doesn't exactly pick up on the patterns we might have hoped for. And to really drive this point home, watch what happens when you input a random image. If the system was smart, you might expect it to feel uncertain, maybe not really activating any of those 10 output neurons or activating them all evenly, but instead it confidently gives you some nonsense answer, as if it feels as sure that this random noise is a 5 as it does that an actual image of a 5 is a 5. Phrased differently, even if this network can recognize digits pretty well, it has no idea how to draw them. A lot of this is because it's such a tightly constrained training setup. I mean, put yourself in the network's shoes here. From its point of view, the entire universe consists of nothing but clearly defined unmoving digits centered in a tiny grid, and its cost function never gave it any incentive to be anything but utterly confident in its decisions. So with this as the image of what those second layer neurons are really doing, you might wonder why I would introduce this network with the motivation of picking up on edges and patterns. I mean, that's just not at all what it ends up doing. Well, this is not meant to be our end goal, but instead a starting point. Frankly, this is old technology, the kind researched in the 80s and 90s, and you do need to understand it before you can understand more detailed modern variants, and it clearly is capable of solving some interesting problems, but the more you dig into what those hidden layers are really doing, the less intelligent it seems. Shifting the focus for a moment from how networks learn to how you learn, that'll only happen if you engage actively with the material here somehow. One pretty simple thing I want you to do is just pause right now and think deeply for a moment about what changes you might make to this system and how it perceives images if you wanted it to better pick up on things like edges and patterns. But better than that, to actually engage with the material, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen on deep learning and neural networks. In it, you can find the code and the data to download and play with for this exact example, and the book will walk you through step by step what that code is doing. What's awesome is that this book is free and publicly available, so if you do get something out of it, consider joining me in making a donation towards Nielsen's efforts. I've also linked a couple other resources I like a lot in the description, including the phenomenal and beautiful blog post by Chris Ola and the articles in Distill. To close things off here for the last few minutes, I want to jump back into a snippet of the interview I had with Leisha Lee. You might remember her from the last video, she did her PhD work in deep learning. In this little snippet she talks about two recent papers that really dig into how some of the more modern image recognition networks are actually learning. Just to set up where we were in the conversation, the first paper took one of these particularly deep neural networks that's really good at image recognition, and instead of training it on a properly labeled dataset, shuffled all the labels around before training. Obviously the testing accuracy here was going to be no better than random, since everything's just randomly labeled. But it was still able to achieve the same training accuracy as you would on a properly labeled dataset. Basically, the millions of weights for this particular network were enough for it to just memorize the random data, which raises the question for whether minimizing this cost function actually corresponds to any sort of structure in the image, or is it just memorization? ...to memorize the entire dataset of what the correct classification is. And so half a year later at ICML this year, there was not exactly rebuttal paper, but paper that addressed some aspects of like, hey, actually these networks are doing something a little bit smarter than that. If you look at that accuracy curve if you were just training on a random data set that curve went down very slowly, almost in a linear fashion. So you\u2019re really struggling to find that local minimum of the right weights. Whereas if you're actually training on a structured dataset, one that has the right labels, you fiddle around a little bit in the beginning, but then you kind of dropped very fast to get to that accuracy level, and so in some sense it was easier to find that local maxima. And so what was also interesting about that is it brings into light another paper from actually a couple of years ago, which has a lot more simplifications about the network layers, but one of the results was saying how if you look at the optimization landscape, the local minima that these networks tend to learn are actually of equal quality, so in some sense if your dataset is structured, you should be able to find that much more easily.

        "Transcript": "Hi, I\u2019m Carrie Anne, and welcome to Crash\nCourse Computer Science! Today, let\u2019s start by thinking about how\nimportant vision can be. Most people rely on it to prepare food, walk\naround obstacles, read street signs, watch videos like this, and do hundreds of other\ntasks. Vision is the highest bandwidth sense, and\nit provides a firehose of information about the state of the world and how to act on it. For this reason, computer scientists have\nbeen trying to give computers vision for half a century, birthing the sub-field of computer\nvision. Its goal is to give computers the ability\nto extract high-level understanding from digital images and videos. As everyone with a digital camera or smartphone\nknows, computers are already really good at capturing photos with incredible fidelity\nand detail \u2013 much better than humans in fact. But as computer vision professor Fei-Fei Li\nrecently said, \u201cJust like to hear is the not the same as to listen. To take pictures is not the same as to see.\u201d INTRO As a refresher, images on computers are most\noften stored as big grids of pixels. Each pixel is defined by a color, stored as\na combination of three additive primary colors: red, green and blue. By combining different intensities of these\nthree colors, what\u2019s called a RGB value, we can represent any color. Perhaps the simplest computer vision algorithm\n\u2013 and a good place to start \u2013 is to track a colored object, like a bright pink ball. The first thing we need to do is record the\nball\u2019s color. For that, we\u2019ll take the RGB value of the\ncentermost pixel. With that value saved, we can give a computer\nprogram an image, and ask it to find the pixel with the closest color match. An algorithm like this might start in the\nupper right corner, and check each pixel, one at time, calculating the difference from\nour target color. Now, having looked at every pixel, the best\nmatch is very likely a pixel from our ball. We\u2019re not limited to running this algorithm\non a single photo; we can do it for every frame in a video, allowing us to track the\nball over time. Of course, due to variations in lighting,\nshadows, and other effects, the ball on the field is almost certainly not going to be\nthe exact same RGB value as our target color, but merely the closest match. In more extreme cases, like at a game at night,\nthe tracking might be poor. And if one of the team's jerseys used the\nsame color as the ball, our algorithm would get totally confused. For these reasons, color marker tracking and\nsimilar algorithms are rarely used, unless the environment can be tightly controlled. This color tracking example was able to search\npixel-by-pixel, because colors are stored inside of single pixels. But this approach doesn\u2019t work for features\nlarger than a single pixel, like edges of objects, which are inherently made up of many\npixels. To identify these types of features in images,\ncomputer vision algorithms have to consider small regions of pixels, called patches. As an example, let\u2019s talk about an algorithm\nthat finds vertical edges in a scene, let\u2019s say to help a drone navigate safely through\na field of obstacles. To keep things simple, we\u2019re going to convert\nour image into grayscale, although most algorithms can handle color. Now let\u2019s zoom into one of these poles to\nsee what an edge looks like up close. We can easily see where the left edge of the\npole starts, because there\u2019s a change in color that persists across many pixels vertically. We can define this behavior more formally\nby creating a rule that says the likelihood of a pixel being a vertical edge is the magnitude\nof the difference in color between some pixels to its left and some pixels to its right. The bigger the color difference between these\ntwo sets of pixels, the more likely the pixel is on an edge. If the color difference is small, it\u2019s probably\nnot an edge at all. The mathematical notation for this operation\nlooks like this \u2013 it\u2019s called a kernel or filter. It contains the values for a pixel-wise multiplication, the sum of which is saved into the center pixel. Let\u2019s see how this works for our example\npixel. I\u2019ve gone ahead and labeled all of the pixels\nwith their grayscale values. Now, we take our kernel, and center it over\nour pixel of interest. This specifies what each pixel value underneath\nshould be multiplied by. Then, we just add up all those numbers. In this example, that gives us 147. That becomes our new pixel value. This operation, of applying a kernel to a\npatch of pixels, is call a convolution. Now let\u2019s apply our kernel to another pixel. In this case, the result is 1. Just 1. In other words, it\u2019s a very small color\ndifference, and not an edge. If we apply our kernel to every pixel in the\nphoto, the result looks like this, where the highest pixel values are where there are strong\nvertical edges. Note that horizontal edges, like those platforms\nin the background, are almost invisible. If we wanted to highlight those features,\nwe\u2019d have to use a different kernel \u2013 one that\u2019s sensitive to horizontal edges. Both of these edge enhancing kernels are called\nPrewitt Operators, named after their inventor. These are just two examples of a huge variety\nof kernels, able to perform many different image transformations. For example, here\u2019s a kernel that sharpens\nimages. And here\u2019s a kernel that blurs them. Kernels can also be used like little image\ncookie cutters that match only certain shapes. So, our edge kernels looked for image patches\nwith strong differences from right to left or up and down. But we could also make kernels that are good\nat finding lines, with edges on both sides. And even islands of pixels surrounded by contrasting\ncolors. These types of kernels can begin to characterize\nsimple shapes. For example, on faces, the bridge of the nose\ntends to be brighter than the sides of the nose, resulting in higher values for line-sensitive\nkernels. Eyes are also distinctive \u2013 a dark circle\nsounded by lighter pixels \u2013 a pattern other kernels are sensitive to. When a computer scans through an image, most\noften by sliding around a search window, it can look for combinations of features indicative\nof a human face. Although each kernel is a weak face detector\nby itself, combined, they can be quite accurate. It\u2019s unlikely that a bunch of face-like\nfeatures will cluster together if they\u2019re not a face. This was the basis of an early and influential\nalgorithm called Viola-Jones Face Detection. Today, the hot new algorithms on the block\nare Convolutional Neural Networks. We talked about neural nets last episode,\nif you need a primer. In short, an artificial neuron \u2013 which is\nthe building block of a neural network \u2013 takes a series of inputs, and multiplies each by\na specified weight, and then sums those values all together. This should sound vaguely familiar, because\nit\u2019s a lot like a convolution. In fact, if we pass a neuron 2D pixel data,\nrather than a one-dimensional list of inputs, it\u2019s exactly like a convolution. The input weights are equivalent to kernel\nvalues, but unlike a predefined kernel, neural networks can learn their own useful kernels\nthat are able to recognize interesting features in images. Convolutional Neural Networks use banks of\nthese neurons to process image data, each outputting a new image, essentially digested\nby different learned kernels. These outputs are then processed by subsequent\nlayers of neurons, allowing for convolutions on convolutions on convolutions. The very first convolutional layer might find\nthings like edges, as that\u2019s what a single convolution can recognize, as we\u2019ve already\ndiscussed. The next layer might have neurons that convolve\non those edge features to recognize simple shapes, comprised of edges, like corners. A layer beyond that might convolve on those\ncorner features, and contain neurons that can recognize simple objects, like mouths\nand eyebrows. And this keeps going, building up in complexity,\nuntil there\u2019s a layer that does a convolution that puts it together: eyes, ears, mouth,\nnose, the whole nine yards, and says \u201cah ha, it\u2019s a face!\u201d Convolutional neural networks aren\u2019t required\nto be many layers deep, but they usually are, in order to recognize complex objects and\nscenes. That\u2019s why the technique is considered deep\nlearning. Both Viola-Jones and Convolutional Neural\nNetworks can be applied to many image recognition problems, beyond faces, like recognizing handwritten\ntext, spotting tumors in CT scans and monitoring traffic flow on roads. But we\u2019re going to stick with faces. Regardless of what algorithm was used, once\nwe\u2019ve isolated a face in a photo, we can apply more specialized computer vision algorithms\nto pinpoint facial landmarks, like the tip of the nose and corners of the mouth. This data can be used for determining things\nlike if the eyes are open, which is pretty easy once you have the landmarks \u2013 it\u2019s\njust the distance between points. We can also track the position of the eyebrows;\ntheir relative position to the eyes can be an indicator of surprise, or delight. Smiles are also pretty straightforward to\ndetect based on the shape of mouth landmarks. All of this information can be interpreted\nby emotion recognition algorithms, giving computers the ability to infer when you\u2019re\nhappy, sad, frustrated, confused and so on. In turn, that could allow computers to intelligently\nadapt their behavior... maybe offer tips when you\u2019re confused, and not ask to install\nupdates when you\u2019re frustrated. This is just one example of how vision can\ngive computers the ability to be context sensitive, that is, aware of their surroundings. And not just the physical surroundings \u2013 like\nif you're at work or on a train \u2013 but also your social surroundings \u2013 like if you\u2019re\nin a formal business meeting versus a friend\u2019s birthday party. You behave differently in those surroundings, and so should computing devices, if they\u2019re smart. Facial landmarks also capture the geometry\nof your face, like the distance between your eyes and the height of your forehead. This is one form of biometric data, and it\nallows computers with cameras to recognize you. Whether it\u2019s your smartphone automatically\nunlocking itself when it sees you, or governments tracking people using CCTV cameras, the applications\nof face recognition seem limitless. There have also been recent breakthroughs\nin landmark tracking for hands and whole bodies, giving computers the ability to interpret\na user\u2019s body language, and what hand gestures they\u2019re frantically waving at their internet\nconnected microwave. As we\u2019ve talked about many times in this\nseries, abstraction is the key to building complex systems, and the same is true in computer\nvision. At the hardware level, you have engineers\nbuilding better and better cameras, giving computers improved sight with each passing\nyear, which I can\u2019t say for myself. Using that camera data, you have computer\nvision algorithms crunching pixels to find things like faces and hands. And then, using output from those algorithms,\nyou have even more specialized algorithms for interpreting things like user facial expression\nand hand gestures. On top of that, there are people building\nnovel interactive experiences, like smart TVs and intelligent tutoring systems, that\nrespond to hand gestures and emotion. Each of these levels are active areas of research,\nwith breakthroughs happening every year. And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Today, computer vision is everywhere \u2013 whether\nit\u2019s barcodes being scanned at stores, self-driving cars waiting at red lights, or snapchat filters\nsuperimposing mustaches. And, the most exciting thing is that computer\nscientists are really just getting started, enabled by recent advances in computing, like\nsuper fast GPUs. Computers with human-like ability to see is\ngoing to totally change how we interact with them. Of course, it\u2019d also be nice if they could\nhear and speak, which we\u2019ll discuss next week. I\u2019ll see you then.",

        "Topic": "Natural Language Processing",
        "Video_ID": "fLvJ8VdHLA0",
        "Transcript": "What is natural language processing? Well,\u00a0\nyou're doing it right now, you're listening\u00a0\u00a0 to the words and the sentences that I'm forming\u00a0\nand you are forming some sort of comprehension\u00a0\u00a0 from it. And when we ask a computer to do that\u00a0\nthat is NLP, or natural language processing.\u00a0\u00a0 My name is Martin Keen, I'm\u00a0\na Master Inventor at IBM,\u00a0\u00a0 and I've utilized NLP in a good number of\u00a0\nmy invention disclosures. NLP really has a\u00a0\u00a0 really high utility value in all sorts of AI\u00a0\napplications. Now NLP starts with something called\u00a0\u00a0 unstructured text. What is that? Well, that's\u00a0\njust what you and I say, that's how we speak.\u00a0\u00a0 So, for example, some unstructured text is\u00a0\n\"add eggs and milk to my shopping list.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Now you and I understand exactly what that means,\u00a0\nbut it is unstructured at least to a computer. So what we need to do, is to have a structured\u00a0\nrepresentation of that same information that\u00a0\u00a0 a computer can process. Now that might look\u00a0\nsomething a bit more like this where we have a\u00a0\u00a0 shopping list element. And then it has sub\u00a0\nelements within it like an item for eggs, and an item for milk. That is an example of\u00a0\nsomething that is structured. Now the job of natural language processing\u00a0\nis to translate between these two things.\u00a0\u00a0 So NLP sits right in the middle here translating\u00a0\nbetween unstructured and structured data. And when\u00a0\u00a0 we go from structure from unstructured here\u00a0\nto structured this way, that's called NLU, or\u00a0\u00a0 natural language understanding. And when we\u00a0\ngo this way from structured to unstructured,\u00a0\u00a0 that's called natural language generation,\u00a0\nor NLG. We're going to focus today primarily\u00a0\u00a0 on going from unstructured to structured in\u00a0\nnatural language processing now let's think of\u00a0\u00a0 some use cases where nlp might be quite handy.\u00a0\nFirst of all, we've got machine translation. Now when we translate from one language to\u00a0\nanother we need to understand the context of\u00a0\u00a0 that sentence. It's not just a case of taking\u00a0\neach individual word from say English and\u00a0\u00a0 then translating it into another language. We\u00a0\nneed to understand the overall structure\u00a0\u00a0 and context of what's being said. And my\u00a0\nfavorite example of this going horribly wrong\u00a0\u00a0 is if you take the phrase the \"spirit is willing,\u00a0\nbut the flesh is weak\" and you translate that from\u00a0\u00a0 English to Russian and then you translate\u00a0\nthat Russian translation back into English\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to go from the \"spirit is willing,\u00a0\nbut the flesh is weak\" to something a bit more\u00a0\u00a0 like the \"vodka is good, but the meat is\u00a0\nrotten\" which is really not the intended\u00a0\u00a0 context of that sentence whatsoever. So\u00a0\nNLP can help with situations like that. Now\u00a0\u00a0 the the second kind of use case that I like\u00a0\nto mention relates to virtual assistants,\u00a0\u00a0 and also to things like chatbots. Now a virtual\u00a0\nassistant that's something like Siri, or Alexa\u00a0\u00a0 on your phone that is taking human utterances and\u00a0\nderiving a command to execute based upon that. And\u00a0\u00a0 a chatbot is something similar except in written\u00a0\nlanguage and that's taking written language and\u00a0\u00a0 then using it to traverse a decision tree in order\u00a0\nto take an action. NLP is very helpful there.\u00a0\u00a0 Another use case is for sentiment analysis. Now\u00a0\nthis is taking some text perhaps an email message\u00a0\u00a0 or a product review and trying to derive\u00a0\nthe sentiment that's expressed within it.\u00a0\u00a0 So for example, is this product review a positive\u00a0\nsentiment or a negative sentiment, is it written\u00a0\u00a0 as a serious statement or is it being sarcastic?\u00a0\nWe can use NLP to tell us. And then finally,\u00a0\u00a0 another good example is spam detection so this\u00a0\nis a case of looking at a given email message\u00a0\u00a0 and trying to drive is this a real email\u00a0\nmessage or is it spam and we can look for\u00a0\u00a0 pointers within the content of the message. So\u00a0\nthings like overused words or poor grammar or an\u00a0\u00a0 inappropriate claim of urgency can all indicate\u00a0\nthat this is actually perhaps spam. So those are\u00a0\u00a0 some of the things that NLP can provide but how\u00a0\ndoes it work well the thing with NLP is it's not like one algorithm, it's actually more like a\u00a0\nbag of tools and you can apply these bag of tools\u00a0\u00a0 to be able to resolve some of these use cases.\u00a0\nNow the input to NLP is some unstructured text\u00a0\u00a0 so either some written text or spoken text that\u00a0\nhas been converted to written text through a\u00a0\u00a0 speech to text algorithm. Once we've got that,\u00a0\nthe first stage of NLP is called tokenization This is about taking a string and breaking\u00a0\nit down into chunks so if we consider the\u00a0\u00a0 unstructured text we've got here \"add\u00a0\neggs and milk to my shopping list\"\u00a0\u00a0 that's eight words that can be eight tokens.\u00a0\u00a0 And from here on in we are going to work one\u00a0\ntoken at a time as we traverse through this. Now\u00a0\u00a0 the first stage once we've got things down into\u00a0\ntokens that we can perform is called stemming. And this is all about deriving the word stem\u00a0\nfor a given token. So for example, running,\u00a0\u00a0 runs, and ran, the word stem for all three of\u00a0\nthose is run. We're just kind of removing the\u00a0\u00a0 prefix and the suffixes and normalizing the\u00a0\ntense and we're getting to the word stem.\u00a0\u00a0 But stemming doesn't work well for every\u00a0\ntoken. For example, universal and university,\u00a0\u00a0 well they don't really stem down to\u00a0\nuniverse. For situations like that,\u00a0\u00a0 there is another tool that we have\u00a0\navailable and that is called lemmatization.\u00a0\u00a0 And lemmatization takes a given token and learns\u00a0\nits meaning through a dictionary definition\u00a0\u00a0 and from there it can derive its root, or its lem.\u00a0\nSo take better for example, better is derived from\u00a0\u00a0 good so the root, or the lem, of better is good.\u00a0\nThe stem of better would be bet. So you can see\u00a0\u00a0 that it is significant whether we use stemming,\u00a0\nor we use lemmatization for a given token.\u00a0\u00a0 Now next thing we can do is we can do a\u00a0\nprocess called part of speech tagging. And what this is doing is for a given token\u00a0\nit's looking where that token is used within the\u00a0\u00a0 context of a sentence. So take the word make for\u00a0\nexample, if I say \"I'm going to make dinner\", make\u00a0\u00a0 is a verb. But if I ask you \"what make is your\u00a0\nlaptop?\", well make is now a noun. So where that\u00a0\u00a0 token is used in the sentence matters, part of\u00a0\nspeech tagging can help us derive that context.\u00a0\u00a0 And then finally, another stage\u00a0\nis named entity recognition.\u00a0\u00a0 And what this is asking is for a given token\u00a0\nis there an entity associated with it. So\u00a0\u00a0 for example, a token of Arizona has an entity of a\u00a0\nU.S. state whereas a token of Ralph has an entity\u00a0\u00a0 of a person's name. And these are some of the\u00a0\ntools that we can apply in this big bag of tools\u00a0\u00a0 that we have for NLP in order to get from this\u00a0\nunstructured human speech through to something\u00a0\u00a0 structured that a computer can understand. And\u00a0\nonce we've done that then we can apply that\u00a0\u00a0 structured data to all sorts of AI applications.\u00a0\nNow there's obviously a lot more to it than this\u00a0\u00a0 and I've included some links in the description if\u00a0\nyou'd like to know more, but hopefully this made\u00a0\u00a0 some sense and that you were able to process some\u00a0\nof the natural language that I've shared today.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for watching.

        "Transcript": "The miniscule world\nof quantum particles might be foreign\nto most of us \u2014 but not for the scientists currently\nusing them to build a super-computer. Nobody knows what \"quantum\ncomputing\" really means, but it is going\nto change us. To its champions, quantum\ncomputers are a pioneering development and a game-changer. The quantum computer can open\nup an array of amazing possibilities. The scale of computer power\nenables us to solve problems that we are not yet\neven able to formulate. Its many applications\ninclude simulating molecules: A ground-breaking advance in\nthe development of new drugs. Quantum computing\nis still in its infancy \u2014 but is set to one day\nrevolutionize scientific research. What looks like a computer\nchip made of plastic is in fact a model\nof a human lung. Scientists at a Swiss start-up\nare aiming to tackle diseases faster \u2014 with the help of\na super-computer. Nina Hobi founded Alveolix\ntogether with Janick Stucki. Their work won them the\n2022 Swiss Med Tech Award. The team here use a pipette\nto transfer human lung cells to a thin, porous\nmembrane. The cells can then be activated\nmechanically, to mimic a real lung. We're able to simulate these\ncells by recreating the environment of the human body\nin this plastic chip. It enables us to simulate miniature\norgans that are far more similar to the real thing than any\nother options currently available. More similar than with in-vitro\ntesting or animal experiments. The researchers say\nthe mock miniature lung will make it easier\nto design new drugs. The drug development process\ntakes around 10 to 15 years. To begin with, you test a huge\nnumber of molecules in petri-dishes \u2014 although there, the cells aren't\nreally like they are in the human body. There are no 3D layers or\nforces of attraction, for example. It's a very basic set-up. You later\nmove on to animal experiments and conduct tests for,\nsay, toxic properties. The entire process\nis extremely involved, especially when you think\nabout the animal testing required. And this is where our\ntechnology comes in. It's hoped the miniature\nlung will enable researchers, most notably at\npharmaceutical companies, to speed up the\ndrug-testing process. Here we have the endophil cells\nand the immune cells on top of it. They\u2019re actually\nattached to it. Did you do\nan infection? We can determine far earlier whether\na particular molecule is effective and whether there\nare side-effects. It enables you to optimize the\nprocess and ultimately lower costs \u2014 by 500 million francs per\ndrug, according to studies. Things that are already possible\ntoday could be done even faster and more efficiently\nwith the technology \u2014 while also rendering\nanimal experiments redundant. Our company's aim is to help in\nthe development of better medication and the reduction of\nside-effects for patients. We also want our technology to help\nreduce or eliminate animal testing. Animal experiments are\nsimply not adequate predictors of whether a drug\nactually works with humans. It was my doctoral supervisor\nwho originally got me interested in quantum computing.\nAnd I'm still there today! Back when I started studying physics\nat Zurich technical university, nobody was talking about\nit. I'd never heard of it. Dominik Zumb\u00fchl is a researcher and\nlecturer at the University of Basel, specializing\nin quanta. They're the smallest units\nof energy known to scientists \u2014 but with properties that would\nmake conventional bit-based computers look distinctly\nprimitive. A regular computer with\nregular computing power performs one calculation\nper time unit or 'clock cycle'. In quantum physics, you have countless calculations\nbeing performed in parallel. A prime example is the\nfactorization of very large numbers. In this case, the quantum\ncomputer quickly arrives at the result by simultaneously trying to\ndivide by all possible numbers. A classical computer processing a\nnumber with several thousand digits would take as long\nas the universe is old. But the same problem can be\nsolved by a quantum computer in a matter of hours\nor even seconds. So what actually are quanta?\nExploring this mysterious little world requires us to think in the\nsmallest possible dimensions. Smaller still\nthan atoms. At this tiniest-imaginable\nscale, the classical laws of nature no longer apply and\nsomething fascinating happens. Quanta can exist in different\nstates and in different places at the same time. Quantum theory was\npioneered in the 1920s by the likes of Albert Einstein\nand Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger. They used thought experiments to\nillustrate these apparent paradoxes that stretch the limits\nof our imagination. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was\nan Austrian physicist primarily known today because\nof a cat. More specifically: An experiment that he fortunately\nnever carried out in practice. He imagined a cat in a\nbox together with a device that would have a 50:50 chance\nof releasing a deadly poison in the next hour. According to\nquantum theory, the cat is then simultaneously\nboth dead and alive. But only provided we\ndon't check inside the box! In a quantum\nmechanics system, mere observation influences\nthe actual state inside. We cannot make an\nassessment without looking \u2014 including whether\nthe cat is dead or alive. What sounds absurd was a\ndemonstration of the conundrum at the heart of\nquantum mechanics. The simultaneously different\nstates at the quantum level are not compatible with accepted\nlaws of nature. In this little world, particles can be linked or\n'entangled' with each other while at the same time being\nin different states and places. And that simultaneity\ncan be calculated. It's a state that can be called\n'mathematical superposition' or... simultaneity. That state \u2014\nrepresented as wave function 'psi' \u2014 comprises a coefficient for an\nupward spin plus another coefficient for a downward spin.\nAnd this is simultaneity. And that's how you\ncan imagine a qubit: an arrow pointing in\na random direction. Quantum- or 'q' bits are the building\nblocks of a quantum computer. While a normal computer\nprocesses information in bits \u2014 as ones or zeroes \u2014 qubits\nhave both values at the same time. It's comparable\nto a flipped coin, where you don't know\nwhether it will land heads or tails. Before these qubits can be\ncontrolled and used for calculations, they have to\nbe immobilized. That in turn requires a complex\nprocedure in which they are cooled down to temperatures otherwise\nseen in outer-space. Around minus 270\ndegrees Celsius. So the surface area\nhelps to exchange the heat, so the cold liquid which we're pumping\nout is cooling the recondensing liquid which is coming down. We can\nactually then do the experiments at temperatures\ndown to 10 milli-Kelvin. Compared to 4 Kelvin that's about\n400 times colder in temperature. PhD students here at the\nUniversity of Basel are assembling a small quantum computer\nwith a small number of qubits. The aim is to deploy the technology\nfor a variety of applications once it's been\nfully developed. Quantum computers would\nthen simulate molecules, for example \u2014 leading to the\ndevelopment of new drugs and the elimination\nof deadly diseases. Another potential application\nis renewable energy storage. The technology has already brought\nbenefits to logistics operations. The introduction of quantum algorithms\nhas helped to increase the speed and capacity of cargo movement\nat the port of Los Angeles. As a result, the facility now operates\nmore efficiently and with less energy. Quantum computing seems to have\nhighly lucrative business potential. For years now, a range of tech\ncompanies including Google and IBM \u2014 and nation-state players\nlike China \u2014 have been in a race to build the first high-performance\nquantum computer. The money invested in\nresearch is in the billions. Switzerland has a\ndifferent approach. Uptown Basel Infinity\nuses private-sector funding to provide companies with free\naccess to American quantum computers. The hub is called QuantumBasel\nand is headed by Damir Bogdan. The problems facing industries\nare getting increasingly complex. The use of artificial\nintelligence is a factor, of course. But when you eventually reach certain\nlimits \u2014 and AI reaches its limits \u2014 then you have to think\na couple of steps ahead. Artificial intelligence applications\ncould run far more efficiently on quantum computers.\nAnd when I say 'efficiency', I mean not only computing\nspeed but also energy efficiency. The hub works\nwith a hybrid system combining conventional\nand quantum computers. Start-ups in the program can\nturn to IBM's Frederik Fl\u00f6ther for advice on tackling their problems\n\u2014 and on thinking outside of the box. The first thing is to break\ndown the individual issues and look at which specific\nquantum algorithm is at all relevant. And as quantum is a completely\ndifferent kind of calculating, it enables you to give\nproblems a complete rethink and perhaps find\na new approach. This involves what we call\nthe Quantum State of Mind. Some 40 studies have\nalready been conducted on the basis of the quantum computer\nwith the purpose of simplifying and accelerating the\ndevelopment of medication. In both medicine\nand health care, we're seeing a significant\nincrease in the data available \u2014 and also in the\nrange of data... image data, data\nfrom fitness trackers, data in medical\nrecords and so on. And processing the complex\ncorrelations between all those data requires the kind of computing\npower that classical computers struggle to achieve. And that's where\nquantum computers have real potential. An example from the\npharmaceutical industry: To date, researchers\nhave covered just 1% of all potentially active\nmolecules for drugs. This is reflected in cancer\ntreatment, for example. Only one in three patients respond\ndirectly to drug-based therapies. We sadly won't be able to\nresolve all of these challenges with quantum\ncomputing, but we're confident of being\nable to help with some of them. Further south, in Berne, the team\nat Alveolix are hoping to resolve one of those problems\nin the very near future. Quantum computers can be used\nto evaluate huge amounts of data, providing detailed insights\ninto a patient's genetic make-up. The small-scale replica of\na lung \u2014 or another organ \u2014 is designed to deliver more effective\ntreatments for cancer patients. We don't know yet which of the\ndifferent types might be effective. You can look at the genome and wonder\nwhat the best one for the patient is, and maybe make a\ncustomized cocktail. The patient might then\nstart an immuno-therapy. And when they have a break, that's\nwhen we can take a tissue sample. After placing the sample\nonto our organ-on-chip, we would then try out a new cocktail,\nso that it would have a better effect when the patient goes\nfor their next treatment. What's especially crucial for cancer\npatients is minimizing side-effects. Instead of additional suffering,\nyou want them to be safe and getting the most\neffective medication available. And that's where\nwe can help. At the same time, Alveolix wants\nto help eliminate animal testing from preclinical\nstudies. For decades, animal experiments\nhave been standard procedure in the development of new drugs, with\nrodents the most widely used species. In Switzerland\nalone, labs perform tests on over\nhalf a million animals a year. Our immediate objective is\nto reduce animal experiments. There are a large number of\ndrugs that are only effective with the human genome and human cells,\nmaking animal tests of zero advantage. So effective drugs don't\neven reach the market because they're stopped prematurely\nin the pre-clinical study phase. Our aim is not removing\nall of them from the market but abolishing the\nmost severe tests where the animals are under\nextreme pain and duress. Experiments with\nseverity levels 3 and 4. And we're very optimistic about\nhelping to make this happen soon. But in Europe, their\nefforts face a hurdle. The European Medicines Agency\nrefuses to grant approval for drugs without animal testing beforehand.\nIn the United States, however, a bill passed in 2022 removed\nthe requirement for animal tests prior to market\napproval. And a proposed update on that\nlegislation would also allow tests using computer models\nor artificial organs. There is already large-scale\nresearch in the US on this front \u2014 as seen at the Cleveland\nClinic in the state of Ohio. The latest breakthrough there is\nan in-house quantum computer. It's the first quantum computer in\nthe world to be uniquely dedicated to healthcare research. And its\nwork will be much appreciated, given the clinic's 10 million\npatient-visits per year. John R. Smith is a senior researcher\nat IBM and highlights the dividends from the vast amounts\nof medical data: This has the potential to\ndrive our pace of progress to addressing the important\ndisease challenges that we\u2019re facing \u2014 and challenges in patient\ncare. So much faster. And to produce\nbreakthroughs and discoveries that will be absolutely\nessential for all of us. In March 2023 the\nclinic officially unveiled its treasured\nquantum computer. Its CEO welcomed guests\nfrom Cleveland and further afield. Thank you\nvery much. We\u2019re bringing something new to\nour organization and to the world. The quantum computer System I \u2014 it\nsounds a little bit science fiction \u2014 which is right behind me, is the most\nadvanced computational technology and computational\nplatform that exists. We\u2019re very excited because it is going\nto allow to us to advance research, advance discovery and\nadvance medical care. And it will also\ncreate a lot of jobs. Among the guests invited to\nthe event was Damir Bogdan from QuantumBasel and\nUptownBasel \u2014 which is no coincidence. The US is the leading market in the\ndevelopment of quantum computers \u2014 and Uptown is\na partner of IBM. An Australian think-tank published\na study citing 44 technologies that will change the world. And China\nis already leading in 37 of them. And one of the\nremaining seven, where the US is ahead, is\nthe field of quantum computing. Bad news for\nthe EU too, with a failed partnership agreement\nmaking cooperation more difficult. The decision by Switzerland or the\nEU that Switzerland cannot be involved in the Horizon program means we have\nto find someone else to work with. It doesn't mean UptownBasel\nis no longer interested in European\npartnerships. But we are in the US a lot\nbecause of all that's happening there. Another attraction for\nthe company executive is the Silicon-Valley\nmentality \u2014 a world away from the conservative,\nrisk-averse approach in Switzerland. That said: Switzerland does\nhave a lot of strong points. We have brilliant research in\nthis area \u2014 in Basel, at the EPFL and Zurich\nTechnical University. What we're missing\nsometimes is the proper climate for start-ups\nto grow in \u2014 and that's a lot\nbetter in the US. The quantum computer's evolution to\ndate promises incredible opportunities in the future. But scientists in universities are\nmore cautious about developments. There's a risk of it\nperhaps taking longer, and of certain\nproblems cropping up. Building a quantum computer that can\nimmediately solve gigantic problems won't be easy. It will have\nto be one step at a time. Today's computers took\nmany, many years to develop. And quantum computers\nwill likely be the same, and need 10 years\nor more to complete. Right now, we're still\nresearching the basics. More qubits means more computing\npower. The IBM quantum computers in commercial use today have\n433 of them \u2014 although currently, pure research is still focused on\nthe physics of the individual qubits. Some qubits are\nrelatively easy to make. There are already computers\nwith 100 or a thousand of them \u2014 and plans for reaching\n10,000 or 100,000. The problem is that the\nquality isn't good enough yet, with a relatively high frequency\nof mistakes in calculations. There's no point having\nas many qubits as possible if they're not\ngood enough. We need major\nimprovements, including work on individual or a\nsmaller number of coupled qubits. But the race\nis totally open. Zurich's Technical University is\nanother center of qubit research. Professor of theoretical\nphysics Renato Renner says that the development of the quantum\ncomputer has still barely begun: Quantum computers are at a\nsimilar stage to early transistors. They're still very big. The 100 qubits\nmight together take up the space of a massive experiments\ntable with all the lab electronics. And it's not yet clear how we\ncould scale it down to at some point pack millions of qubits\ninto a small space have a feasible\nworking setup. That doesn't\nmean we can't do it, but comparatively speaking we're\nstill in the vacuum-tube computer era. Think how back then there was\nnobody talking about the Internet or social media! We cannot\nyet appreciate the potential \u2014 nor the dangers\neither, of course. Renato Renner is familiar with\nthe dangers of quantum computing. He gives lectures in\ncryptography \u2014 data encryption. Quantum computers really do pose\na threat to today's data security. When we do e-banking or use encrypted\ncommunication in other contexts, we need what's called\n'public-key cryptography'. And that system will\nbecome completely insecure once we have quantum\ncomputers up and running. Whoever has the quantum computer\nwill have full and immediate access to all of that data. And that's\na very concrete problem. So far, a simple mathematical method\nhas been sufficient to protect our data: Factorization. Some calculations are straightforward,\nsay: 3 times 7 equals 21. But if I turn it\naround and ask: What are two numbers\nthat give us that product, then I basically have to try\nout all possible combinations. And with the numbers having up to a\nhundred digits, I'll be at it forever. Not even a computer\nthat can process far faster will be able to test all\nhundred-digit numbers. A quantum computer, on the other hand,\ncan try out the numbers in parallel \u2014 and arrive at the result\nin a fraction of a second. The implications have\nexperts concerned. We're relatively\nlate to the game, because we know the secrecy\nof the data being encrypted has a very\nlimited lifespan. The things that I encrypt today\nusing public-key cryptography will be readable once the\nquantum computer exists. Data can then only be encrypted by\nagain using the quantum computer. In effect: by beating the enemy\nat its own game. And this is how: The sender of the data generates\nqubits with a value of 0 or 1 \u2014 and then sends a\ncompletely random sequence of those qubits\nto the recipient. It serves as a key that\nonly those two parties know. Of course, someone could\ntry to spy on the transfer \u2014 but this is where quantum\nmechanics enters the equation. An attempt to intercept the\nqubits will now change them \u2014 with both sender and\nrecipient alerted immediately. So the key cannot be\nsecretly copied or read. The actual encrypted\nmessage is not transferred until the key has\nfirst arrived un-read. The problem is:\nin technical terms, the idea is currently\nnot really feasible. It sounds extremely difficult\nif not near-impossible, but we know that it really\ndoes work \u2014 but it is expensive. A solution that is absolutely secure\nis going to cost a lot of money. But looking at a\nlong-term horizon \u2014 not 10 but more like 40 or 50\nyears \u2014 then it could be a solution. And data security is not the only\nfactor to consider in the long term. Quantum computing still has\na lot of obstacles to overcome \u2014 meaning that investors\nwill have to be patient. Everyone's talking\nabout quantum computing, but we can't expect to\nhave this killer application in just a few\nyears from now. It's going to take a lot of\ndevelopment stages and investment to get to the point where\nthe application is available. And above all: time \u2014 although\nthat in turn depends on investment. Investment is far higher than we\ncould have imagined a few years ago. So that is reason\nto be optimistic. There are start-ups and\ncompanies following the hype, and eager to invest\nin this future concept. As a result: Graduates studying physics and\nquantum computing have a range of jobs to choose from in the various\nstart-ups or big tech firms pursuing quantum\ncomputing projects. There's a huge\nnumber of options. We can't imagine the changes involved\n\u2014 because they're quantum leaps! And that's why we\nneed 'moon shots' \u2014 projects where you aim in a\ndirection where you can't lose sight of the vision but\nwill probably have to make a few\nadjustments along the way. And that's not possible, unless\nwe find a new way of thinking.",

        "Transcript": "Welcome back to the Cybersecurity Architecture Series. In the previous two videos, I talked about identity management and endpoint security, and now we're going to focus on the network. The network security involves a lot of different elements, and we're going to talk about each of these-- --about firewalls, which are a fundamental component of this, about segmentation, which we're able to do with using firewalls, about virtual private networks, about SASE. You'll hear more about that in a few minutes. And then, actually, the topic is so large and so mature, you really can't cover it all in this space. So there's going to be some things I'm not going to get a chance to talk about. But needless to say, there's a lot more that could be discussed here. So, first thing we're going to talk about are firewalls. So let's talk about what are we going to do with firewalls. The idea behind them in the first place where the technology and the notion even came from is in the physical world, a physical firewall. Let's say we've got three townhouses all connected. And this guy has a fire in his unit. Well, what we'd like is to have some way to limit the spread of that fire from one unit to the next. It might not make it completely go away, but it slows it down so that the fire department can get there and do something about it. So it's a way of creating isolation and protection from a dangerous event. So take that concept in mind and then apply it to a network scenario. Here we've got a user on a workstation hitting a web server, and that web server then goes against a database. The typical architecture we put in here is we add a firewall here and a firewall here. One that's Internet facing and one that is internal facing. And what we're going to do, the reason we're putting two of these here, we'll talk more about it in segmentation. But simply what we're going to do here, in the most basic form, is we're going to filter based upon certain things that are happening here. This is this notion of packet filtering. With packet filtering, I'm going to look into the packet, that is, the information that's being sent from this guy to this guy. And in that, he's going to include things like his source address, that is, the address that he's coming from, his destination address, where he wants it to go, which is going to be this web server and the port that he's going to use, which is a way of designating what kind of traffic it is. So this firewall can then filter based upon that information that's in the header of that packet. And he's going to look at and say, okay, port 80, that's the standard industry standard for unencrypted Internet traffic. So I'm going to allow that web traffic to come through on port 80, that we will allow. We will also allow encrypted traffic. So this is your SSL or now TLS encrypted web traffic. So I'm going to open this first firewall to allow that information to flow through. But I'm also going to add some more things to make it a little tighter. I'm going to say the source address has to be in the range of the external Internet. Why would we look at that? Well, I want to make sure that somebody isn't spoofing and acting like they're coming from inside. Sometimes we'll trust traffic that comes from the inside and give it more privileges and sort of drop our guard. We don't want that to happen from external traffic. So if this packet is literally coming from the outside and claims to be coming from the inside, we're going to block it. It's just going to be blocked right here. The destination address, we're going to say, where you can go is you must in fact only go there. If this guy tries to put any other address, like here, if he tries to go to the database directly, that will be blocked, because that destination address is not something we're going to allow through the first firewall. Now we have a second firewall here that's going to add even a little more security. It's going to say this is the traffic, this is the port we're going to open up to allow this kind of traffic between the web server and the database. We're going to allow a source address only of the web server. So I'm not going to allow anything that came from the Internet, the external world, if it's got that address as its source, where it started from, I'm not going to allow it. It has to have originated here and its destination can only be that. So what we've done in creating that set of rules is any traffic from the outside can only get to and must stop over here where it can be inspected and where we can implement some sort of security controls. It cannot get anywhere else. So that's what we're basically doing here, and you can keep applying these kinds of rules in order to tighten up your security. And what we're doing, what I've described here, is basically this idea of packet filtering where we're essentially just looking here at the packet that is, the first part of the packet, the header. So think of it as like an envelope. If I'm mailing a letter to you, what's going to be on the envelope? Well, we're going to have a to address and we're going to have a return address. This is your to address. This is your return address. So that's what we've basically done here. But we have not looked inside. So there's no inspection, here. But in this next example, I'm going to talk about stateful packet inspection. Where in this case, we're going to look not only at the packet, but we may also go ahead and look at the full thing, look at what's in the payload as well. And there are other things like application firewalls that are specific and they'll do even more inspection of this payload. That is the data that you're actually sending and make sure that it's not going to do harm to us. And in this case, it's more like the open envelope so that we're able to see the contents, not only the to and the from, but we can also see the contents as well. So that's an analogy to help you understand what this is. Stateful packet inspection also looks at the context of the packet. So it's looking at you sent one of these, and then one of these, but you should never have sent that next thing because that breaks all the rules. So it can look at more than just individual packets in isolation, which is what packet filtering does. This was sort of our first generation of firewalling, and then it got more sophisticated when we added stateful packet inspection. But there are other things here as well in this sort of firewall and technologies. Think about these all as a collection of technologies that can be part or not of a particular firewall. And the next one is this idea of a proxy. A proxy is something that acts on behalf of something else. So we have here a workstation that's coming in from the outside and it wants to hit this web server, for instance. Except what I'm going to do is say I'm going to put another server here in between that is the proxy. And what's going to happen is I'm going to break this session. Right now what you see depicted is a direct connection, end-to-end. I insert a proxy, I'm going to tell this guy, you're going to communicate directly with me and he is going to communicate directly with the back end Web server. Now we have two sessions. And what it is, is this guy thinks he's talking here, but in fact, he's talking to this guy. This guy thinks he's talking to this. In fact, he's talking to that. Now we have effectively a man-in-the-middle. But it's a good man in the middle. It's one that we put in there so that we can inspect the traffic. By the way, traffic coming in from the outside into my internal network. Maybe I want to have a look at that before I allow it in, see if it's got viruses or things like that. So I can inspect and I can enforce a security policy, if I need to. That's one of the advantages of putting in a proxy. By the way, sometimes people also put in proxies for privacy reasons, so that they can guard against who's seeing exactly who's doing what. It just looks like everything is coming from the proxy, not the actual end user, in that case. The final bit that I want to talk about here is actually maybe one of the most pervasive of these technologies, network address translation, or NAT for short. This is something that is probably in your home and you're probably using it right now and you may not know it. With NAT, what we do is, the Internet-- So by convention, we've all agreed by industry standard that there is a range of addresses that are reliable across the Internet and a range that are not reliable across the Internet. So this is specified in the in the rules for Internet traffic. If the address starts with a 10, then it doesn't matter what the other numbers are after that, because Internet addresses are always these four numbers separated by periods. That's the way we depict those. If it starts with a 10, if it's a 10 dot address, it is not routable across the Internet. It is routable across an internal intranet or across your home network. If you've got a home router, Wi-Fi router, whatever, you probably will find that it used a 10 dot address or more commonly it's used one of these 192.168 dot something dot something. That's very common in home setups. So this is an internal address that cannot be routed across the internet. That's why we need this NAT box. The NAT box does the translation, that's the T in NAT. So if this guy wants to send traffic that goes out to the Internet, his internal address, if he put that out directly,  it would hit the first router on the internet and get blocked. It wouldn't go anywhere. But in fact, what we're going to do, is the NAT table, the NAT router or NAT firewall maintains a table where it's going to translate this into an external address, usually just a single address that is recognized for everything that's behind here. So it actually conserves IP addresses. I don't need I could have 100 of these different devices back here. They all look like just one address going out to the Internet. So I'm going to translate the traffic as it comes here into something that's routable so it can get out there and it will come back and then the NAT box will turn it back and send it back to the workstation that it needed to go to. Now that's just to preserve existing functionality. Where's the protection? The protection comes in the fact that if this guy out here wants to directly hit this workstation, he can't because the address for this workstation, this 192.168.1.1 is example is not routable across the internet. If he tries to send that, it won't go anywhere. So this way we have internal traffic and external traffic and we can flow this way. But it prevent someone from being able to get from the outside directly to the inside. And as I said, this is very common technology. It's usually built into all of the home routers. Okay, we just talked about firewalls. Now we're going to talk about segmentation. That is, how are we going to apply these firewalls in various network architectures to achieve different levels of security? Let's take the first one. This is the most primitive. I don't recommend this. Don't ever do this. But this in the early days of the Internet was a viable option for a lot of people. It's a bastion host. We basically take our web server and put it on the Internet because what we don't want is the internal network-- intranet --being exposed directly to the Internet. And if I don't put this somewhere outside here, then that means I have to allow all the Internet traffic into my internal network. And that's a really bad idea. So in the early days, people would put a single firewall right here, put their web server out here, or whatever devices, it had to be a bastion, last bastion on on the defense right out here on the edge. Again, not recommended. We have better ways to do it. The sort of next generation of this was a tri-homed network where in this case we've created essentially a firewall that we've carved off here into three different networks. So the firewall that's sitting here recognizes traffic coming in on one network interface card. And this traffic, for instance, all of the Internet traffic will be directed directly into where our Web server is. It's coming in on this network interface card, it will automatically be directed there. And maybe we apply some rules like the packet filtering and stuff like that. But that's where the traffic is destined to go in most cases. And likely in this case, the internal traffic, it's coming in on this network interface card, it could be routed here if somebody's internal user wants to hit our website. But it could also just as equally be trying to go out somewhere here. So here we have a single firewall sitting there, but it's got three different network interface cards. So it's trying to kind of do a lot of work in one place. And that's why it's called tri-homed. This is a DMZ of sorts. A demilitarized zone is the term we use there to refer to an area that's a buffer between an untrusted environment and a more trusted environment. Now, I'm going to use those terms very simplistically with apologies to people who understand what zero trust means, that there's really no trusted networks. But that's why we're essentially trying to show here's the red zone, the untrusted. The yellow zone is the semi trusted and the green zone is the more trusted zone. That's the idea here behind the color coding. Okay, move to the next one, the basic DMZ. And this is very popular. By the way, this last one is one that's often done in home networks. If you want to have an internal network and you want to allow guests to have access or your IoT devices or things like that. If you're hosting your own web server on your home network, not a great idea, but you could do it. You might want to separated out like this because again, it's a low cost option. That's the advantage is, it's very scalable. It's cheap. But on the downside, it's a single point of failure. If this thing doesn't do its job, everything's wide open potentially. Okay, moving on to the basic DMZ, which in this case I'm going to use two firewalls. So automatically I end up with more costs because I've got multiple security protections that I'm putting in place. And it's going to be more complex because I have to administer different rules and different capabilities here. And I gave an example of this in the first frame. In the first example before, when I talked about packet filtering and traffic coming in here and coming out there and so forth. That would be a basic DMZ. We got a red zone, a yellow zone, a green zone. Think of this as the traffic light. This is the danger untrusted, semi trusted caution. And then this is where it's more trusted. And we've built a kind of firewall rules to make sure that this can be trusted, because again, someone cannot go from here to here. We block that. We block that actually at this first firewall and then we have a secondary block here. And as a result, because we've got one block here and another block here, we have defense in depth. You remember going back to the very first video in this series, one of the principles I talked about that was important is this notion of defense in depth. I don't rely on any single security mechanism to protect me. If this firewall fails for some reason, I still can't get traffic from here to there because I've built in a rule that said the source address has to be traffic coming from this web server, for instance. And if this failed and all the traffic was able to come through it, then it would still be blocked by this second. So we've got defense in depth. It's also more scalable. So I could build up multiples of these, multiples of a lot of these kinds of things. So the opportunities are a lot greater. Again, not a single point of failure, but defense in depth. And then finally, I'll talk about a multi-tiered DMZ. So the multi-tiered DMZ, we basically put a firewall here and here. So now we've got this this diagram essentially replicated here. But in this case, I've split out the web server from the application server from the database, in this example. In this case, I'm going to implement yet another firewall, a third firewall in this case. So as you would guess, one of the downsides is it's going to be even more expensive than these others. It is going to be more costly and complex than these others, because now I've got three firewalls to administer and different rules on each one of them. However, we've got defense in depth on steroids. We've got even more because now any one of these mechanisms, it would have to be that all three of them failed. If one of them failed, it wouldn't necessarily be a huge problem for us. We also have greater granularity. That is, I can allow traffic to only go to here from this zone to this zone. I can allow traffic from this zone only to go to that zone and traffic from this zone only to go to that zone and do the reverse back. So more granularity, more firewalls, more cost and complexity. But potentially, if I do it right, more security. Okay, in the previous section, we talked about firewalls and segmentation. Now we're going to cover the next subject of virtual private networking VPNs. Now, what are VPNs designed to do? They're basically trying to give us a secure channel over an untrusted network. That's the idea. I can't necessarily trust the Internet because I don't control I don't have visibility into all of the aspects of that. But I'd like to be able to send secure information or information in a secure way over it. So I want a secure channel over an untrusted network. That would be a great capability. And the way I do that, I accomplish it by encrypting my information and then sending it over the network. The idea there is I get confidentiality. And I get that because people can't see what is in the packet. All they'll see is the encrypted information. We lots of times think about this as a pipe or as a tunnel. You'll hear those kind of analogies used here. Think about if we've got a user here with a browser trying to get to a web server and we're building a secure pipe, a connection from one end to the other. And I'm encrypting all the packets as they go across. So that way someone who looks here sees nothing that they can interpret, nothing that means anything. That's the idea behind a secure pipe, secure channel over an untrusted network. So that's the good stuff. And security guys love that we can do that. What they don't love is this. That is a limited inspection capability, this ability to-- so the good guy can send their traffic without everybody seeing it. It also means a bad guy could send their traffic without everybody seeing it and that would be a problem. So it limits our ability to inspect and therefore see if someone's putting malware into my system or someone's initiating an attack. So it's one of those blessings and a curse at the same time. All right. There are different kinds of VPN technologies. And to understand them, we really need a little bit of understanding on network technologies. A 7 layer OSI stack. This is classic stuff. We're not going to go into it in detail. But the notion is, is that there are different layers. For every packet I send, different concerns, different aspects that are implemented at different layers here. And what happens in the real world is most people, if you're an application programmer, you're really concerned more up here with the application, presentation layers, these kinds of things. And the networking infrastructure, people are much more concerned with the stuff down here at the transport network data link, physical layers and those kinds of things. So there's a little bit off concerns that separate there. But the other thing that's really important about this is, with this model, we have a way of, if you implement a security capability, for instance, at one of these layers, it's inherited by the upper layers. So if I encrypt all my traffic here, then it's encrypted by all the higher layers as well. So from a simple security standpoint, it might be easier to put the encryption down lower in the stack. We'll talk in a minute what hat's not necessarily what you always want to do, though. So there are different examples of how we do this. For instance, at the application layer. You may have heard of this protocol--secure shell. That's an example of an application layer or application specific VPN. It encrypts the data so that you can connect into a particular device console, this sort of thing. There's a secure FTP and other examples like that. Another one that's very common and you're going to run across this all the time, whether you're aware of it or not, is TLS or SSL--transport layer security or secure sockets layer. This is the older term. The newer name for this standard is TLS. It's implemented at the transport layer. That's what you usually see when you're a browser connected to a web server and you see that little lock in the browser up on the the URL line. That's what is is being implemented there, TLS. So that is everything that's going to that Web server then is going to be encrypted. There are other examples. There's a thing called IPsec, which is implemented at the network layer. If you do that, then everything between two network addresses will be encrypted as opposed to between the web server or for a very specific application. And then we have some other examples of point-to-point tunneling protocol, P2PTP or L2TP, which is the layer 2 tunneling protocol. These are some examples of even lower on the stack. So not to go into details on it, but just to give you an idea, there's not a single type of VPN or VPN technology. They all share some of these qualities. And if you see these things, you should think, ah that's a type of VPN. Now what's happening these days, is we're tending to move away from these broad network based VPNs more toward application specific VPNs. What's the reason for that? Well, on the advantage side for the broad ones, is that they're relatively simple. I set up a connection, for instance, between two endpoints or me into a particular network. And everything I do, for instance, if I set up an IPsec session, everything I send into that whole network now will be encrypted. So that's a very simple type of thing to do. However, it doesn't give us the granularity that we get over on this side with a very application specific firewall or VPN like we're doing here with SSH. The other advantage on the broad based side, network-based side, is a catch all. Again, if I encrypt at this layer, then all the traffic, all the different applications can benefit from that basic VPN. I don't have to set up separate ones. So it's simpler in that regard. However, I don't have as much control and as much granularity. The ability to control and say I have a VPN for my email, a VPN for my file sharing application, a VPN for my instant messaging application and control all of those separately gives me more control so that if I need to shut a particular service down or a particular user down, I can do that. So a lot of different possibilities here in this area of VPNs. Okay, now we've covered firewalls, segmentation, VPNs, and our last one is SASE. What is SASE?. It's secure access service edge. That's what the acronym stands for. It's actually a very relevant and important topic these days as part of the larger subject of zero trust. And in fact, another aspect of zero trust that's very relevant is micro-segmentation. And we talked about segmentation before, but micro-segmentation just carries that to the extreme and puts lots and lots of zones within your network with little micro networks. But SASE in particular. What we're trying to do here is create some sort of of secure capability that's delivered on the edge. To think about it this way. Let's look at a Venn diagram. Here, we've got networking concerns here. We've got security things and we've got the cloud. If you think about the intersection of network security and cloud, this is the world where SASE lives. Because-- and depending on how you want to think about this, if you think more mathematically, you might like this description, if you think more visually, you might like this one. We'll go through the mathematical one first. SASE is basically network security plus WAN, wide area networking capability. So that's the network and the security all delivered from the cloud. So that's the way of taking that Venn diagram and expressing it kind of as a loose mathematical equation. So if we were to decompose this a little more, what does it mean? What does the NetSEC mean, network security? Well, it's basically firewalling, which we've talked about. It's secure web gateways, which we didn't really go into detail, but think about those as application-specific firewalls and things of that sort. And DLP, data loss prevention, which is something I'll talk about in the data security domain when we get to that topic. But all of these things and more, delivered on the edge, so that's the network security component of all this. The WAN, specifically, is a software-defined WAN. Which is a way of creating a dynamic network where you can change where the boundaries of the network are and provision these in real-time, effectively. So it gives you a lot more agility and flexibility. So we're adding that capability, this SD-WAN marrying it, merging it, with the network security components and then delivering the thing from the cloud, because the cloud gives us the ability to do scalability. We can scale up and scale down elasticity and agility. Again, lots and lots of flexibility. That's what people are looking for in this case. If I take all of those things and then maybe even add in another thing within the security space, identity management, specifically, authentication and authorization. So some access controls, then this is what SASE is about. It's combining all of these functions into a single logical component and delivering that from the cloud, at the edge of the network. Another way to look at it is this way. So here we've got our users, here we've got the external network, and then I've got this SASE capability that's here in the middle. And what this delivers is on one end, the networking capabilities I mentioned previously, on the other end, also the security capabilities-- firewall and DLP and so forth. So all of this is is a way of combining these functions and delivering them. This is a more modern way of delivering all of these capabilities as opposed to what would have in the past each one of these would have been a separate appliance, a separate component, a separate administrative capability, a separate person to administer it and all of those kinds of things.

A couple of things that I didn't cover and I put here in the etc. just because of the interest of time, I didn't really get into very much in the physical networking side, things like 5G and Wi-Fi and the network security capabilities of those. If there's interest in that, put that down in the comments and maybe we'll revisit that in a future video. Until then, now we've completed the networking portion of our domains.

        "Transcript": "- [Narrator] Cloud computing\nis the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers you can access technology services, such as computing power,\nstorage and databases, on an as-needed basis\nfrom a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services. Organizations of every\ntype, size and industry are using the cloud for a\nwide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer facing web applications. For example, health care companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-rime fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games\nto millions of players around the world. With cloud computing your business can become more agile, reduce costs, instantly scale, and deploy globally in minutes. Cloud computing gives you instance access to a broad range of technologies so you can innovate faster and build nearly anything you can imagine, from infrastructure services such as compute, storage and databases, to internet of things, machine learning, data analytics, and much more. You can deploy technology services in a matter of minutes and get from idea to implementation several orders of magnitude\nfaster than before. This gives you the freedom to experiment and test new ideas to differentiate customer experiences and\ntransform your business, such as adding machine learning and intelligence to your applications in order to personalize experiences for your customers and\nimprove their engagement. You don't need to make large, upfront investments in hardware and overpay for capacity you don't use. Instead you can trade capital expense for variable expense and only pay for IT as you consume it. With cloud computing you access resources from the cloud in real\ntime as they're needed. You can scale these resources up and down to grow or shrink capacity instantly as your business needs change. Cloud computing also\nmakes it easy to expand to new regions and deploy\nglobally in minutes. For example, Amazon Web Services has infrastructure all over the world so you're able to deploy your application in multiple physical locations\nin just a few clicks. Putting applications in closer proximity to end users reduces latency and improves their experience. No matter your location, size or industry, the cloud frees you from\nmanaging infrastructure and data centers so you can focus on what matter most to your business.",

        "Topic": "Edge Computing",
        "Video_ID": "0idvaOCnF9E",
        "Transcript": "Welcome to another video from ExplainingComputers.com. This time I\u2019m going to talk about edge computing. This places networked computing resources as close as possible to where data is created. As we\u2019ll see, edge computing is associated\nwith the Internet of Things, with mesh networks, and with the application of small computing devices like these. So, let\u2019s go and delve more deeply into\ncomputing on the network edge. To understand edge computing we need to reflect\non the rise of the cloud. In recent years, cloud computing has been\none of the biggest digital trends, and involves the delivery of computing resources over the Internet. In the early days, most of the devices that\naccessed cloud services were PCs and other end-user hardware. But increasingly, devices accessing cloud\nservices are also Internet of things or IoT appliances that transmit data for analysis\nonline. Connecting cameras and other sensors to the\nInternet facilitates the creation of smart factories and smart homes. However, transmitting an increasing volume of data for remote, centralized processing is becoming problematic. Not least, transmitting video from online\ncameras to cloud-based vision recognition services can overload available network capacity and result in a slow speed of response. And this is the reason for the rise of edge\ncomputing. Edge computing allows devices that would have relied on the cloud to process some of their own data. So, for example, a networked camera may perform\nlocal vision recognition. This can improve latency -- or the time taken\nto generate a response from a data input -- as well as reducing the cost and requirement\nfor mass data transmission. Staying with our previous example, let\u2019s\nconsider more deeply the application of artificial neural networks for vision recognition. Today, Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft all\noffer cloud vision recognition services that can receive a still image or video feed and\nreturn a cognitive response. These cloud AI services rely on neural networks that have been pre-trained on data center servers When an input is received, then they perform\ninference -- again on a cloud data center server -- to determine what the camera is\nlooking at. Alternatively, in an edge computing scenario, a neural network is usually still trained on a data centre server, as training requires\na lot of computational power. So, for example, a neural network for use\nin a factory may be shown images of correctly produced and then defective products so that\nit can learn to distinguish between the two. But once training is complete, a copy of the\nneural network is deployed to a networked camera connected to edge computing hardware. This allows it to identify defective products\nwithout transmitting any video over the network. Latency is therefore improved and the demands on the network are decreased, as data only has to be reported back when defective products are identified. This scenario of training a neural network\ncentrally and deploying copies for execution at the edge has amazing potential. Here I\u2019ve indicated how it could be used\nin vision recognition. But the same concept is equally applicable\nfor the edge processing of audio, sensor data, and the local control of robots or other cyber physical systems. In fact, edge hardware can be useful in any\nscenario where the roll-out of local computing power at the extremities of a network can\nreduce reliance on the cloud. One of the challenges of both the Internet\nof Things, and of edge computing, is providing an adequate network connection to a vast number\nof cameras, sensors and other devices. Today, the majority of devices connected wirelessly to a local network communicate directly with a WiFi router. However, an alternative model is to create\na mesh network in which all individual nodes dynamically interconnect on an ad-hoc basis to facilitate data exchange. Consider, for example, the placement of moisture and temperature sensors in a large industrial greenhouse. If all of these devices have to have direct\nwired or wireless connectivity, then a lot of infrastructure would need to be put in\nplace. But if the sensors can be connected to edge computing devices that can establish a mesh network, then only one wired or wireless connection to the local network may be required. Edge computing hardware is defined by its\nlocation, not its size, and so some edge devices may be very powerful local servers. But this said, a lot of edge computing is destined to take place on small devices, such as single board computers. Here, for example, we have a LattePanda Alpha and a UDOO BOLT, both of which could be deployed to process data at the edge. Other potential edge devices include the Edge-V from Khadas as we can see here -- this has even got \u201cedge\u201d in its name -- and it\u2019s\ngot multiple camera connectors, which is very useful for edge applications. And then over here we have a Jetson Nano SoM, a system-on-a-module, and this is a particularly interesting single board computer because\nit\u2019s got a 128 CUDA core GPU. So it\u2019s very good for vision recognition\nprocessing at the edge. Another slightly different and very interesting device is this, the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2, or NCS2. This features a Movidius Myriad X vision processing unit, or VPU, and it\u2019s a development kit for prototyping AI edge applications. And if I take off the end here you\u2019ll see\nthis is a cap, and this is actually a USB device. And the idea is you can plug this into a single board computer, such as a Raspberry Pi, in order to significantly increase the capability of a small board like a Raspberry Pi to run edge applications like vision recognition. The exact definition of edge computing remains\na little blurry. This said, all major players agree that it\nplaces networked computing resources as close as possible to where data is created. To provide you with some more extensive definitions, IBM note that \u201cEdge computing is an important emerging paradigm that can expand your operating model by virtualizing your cloud beyond a data center or cloud computing center. Edge computing moves application workloads from a centralized location to remote locations, such as factory floors, warehouses, distribution centers, retail stores, transportation centers, and more\". Similarly, the Open Glossary of Edge Computing\nfrom the Linux Foundation defines edge computing as \u201cThe delivery of computing capabilities\nto the logical extremes of a network in order to improve the performance, operating cost and reliability of applications and services. By shortening the distances between devices and the cloud resources that serve them, and also reducing network hops, edge computing mitigates the latency and bandwidth constraints of today's Internet, ushering in new classes\nof applications\u201d. Cisco have also introduced the term \u201cfog\ncomputing\u201d, which it describes as \u201c. . .a standard that defines how edge computing should work, and [which] facilitates the operation of compute, storage and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers\". What this means is that fog computing refers to resources that lie close to the metaphorical ground, or between the edges of a network\nand the remote cloud. It may be, for example, that in a factory\nsome edge sensors communicate with local fog resources, which in turn communicate as necessary with a cloud data center. It should be noted that the term \u201cfog computing\u201d is mainly used by Cisco, and is viewed by some as a marketing term rather than an entirely distinct paradigm to edge computing. Edge computing is emerging for two reasons. The first is the rising pressure on network\ncapacity. While the second is our growing demand to obtain a faster and faster response from AI and related applications. As a result, while for a decade we\u2019ve been\npushing computing power out to the cloud, increasingly we\u2019re also be pushing it in\nthe opposite direction to the local extremities of our networks. More information on a wide range of computing developments -- including AI, blockchain and quantum computing -- can be found here on the ExplainingComputers YouTube channel.

        "Video_ID": "dWwsco4xzEk",
        "Transcript": "The word 5G is making a buzz over the last\nfew years. And even in many counties, the initial phase\nof the 5G deployment is going on. And even in the last couple of years, many\n5G smartphones are also launched. Now, when we hear the word 5G, then the first\nthing which comes in our mind is high-speed internet. But this 5G is more than just high-speed internet. So, to understand that, first of all, let's\nunderstand what is 5G. So, this 5G stands for the fifth generation\nof mobile network technology. And in many aspects, it is different from\nthe previous generations. So, in the future, this 5G technology will\nprovide three main types of services. That is fast internet, the Internet of Things\nas well as low latency communication. So, technically, these three features are\nknown as enhanced mobile broadband, the massive machine to machine type of communication,\nand ultra-reliable low latency communication. So, as I said, this massive machine to machine\ntype of communication will enable the Internet of Things, where millions of devices can be\nconnected together without human intervention. And these devices will be able to communicate\nwith each other wirelessly. Apart from that, it will also enable the gates\nfor smart homes and smart cities. So, per the 5G specifications, it will support\nthe connection density of 1 million devices over the 1-kilometer area. which is 10 times more than the maximum supported\ncapacity of the 4G network. Then the next feature is enhanced mobile broadband,\nthat is blazing fast internet service. So, as per the 5G specifications, theoretically,\nit will support the peak download speed of 20 Gbps and the upload speed of 10 Gbps. And when the signal is low, or at the edge\nof the cell, it will provide the maximum speed of 100 Mbps. So, this will enable the services which require\nvery high bandwidth. That means with the blazing fast speed, the\nconsumers will be able to download the HD movies in a few seconds. Moreover, it will also accelerate the adoption\nof augmented and virtual reality-based services. Not only that, but it will also accelerate the\nconcept of cloud-based gaming. Then the next technical goal or the next feature\nwhich 5G will provide is the low latency communication. So, these 5G features will allow communication\nwith a latency of as low as 1ms. So, this feature will enable the real-time\nservices which require very low latency and the prompt response. Like autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries,\nand interactive gaming. Apart from that, it will be also very helpful\nin the automation industries where fast machine to machine communication and ultra-reliable\ncommunication is very critical. which will avoid system failure as well as\nthe loss of life. So, this is how 5G will enable the new services\nto the consumers with very high reliability. And here is the quick comparison between the\n4G and 5G technology. So, now let's talk about the 5G spectrum or\nthe 5G frequency bands. So, this 5G will support the two frequency\nranges. One frequency range is known as the sub 6GHz\nband, while the second band is known as the millimeter-wave band. Now, initially, in this first frequency range,\nthe frequency was limited up to 6 GHz. But later on, it was extended up to 7 GHz. Now, this first frequency band can further\nbe divided into the low band and mid-band frequencies. So, these low-band frequencies contain frequencies\nwhich is less than 1 GHz. And at this low frequencies, this band provides\nvery good coverage. So, these band of frequencies can be used\nto provide the coverage even in the interior parts. On the other end, this mid-band provides moderate\ncoverage, but because of the increased bandwidth, the data speed will be better than the previous\ngenerations. So, currently, in many countries, this mid-band\nis used for the 5G deployment. But the true 5G experience and 5G speeds like\n1 Gbps can be achieved with the help of a millimeter-wave band. So, because of it's high frequency, this band\nprovides very high bandwidth and it can provide a blazing fast internet to the end-user. But since the millimeter waves can't travel\nmuch distance, so the coverage in this band will be limited to only tens of meters. So, because of that, the cells in this millimeter-wave\nband are known as the small cells. Now, as these small cells provide limited\ncoverage, so when mobile network operator wants to provide\nreally high-speed internet experience to the user then they need to install even a hundred or even\nthousands of such small cells in the particular area. Now, at the millimeter-wave frequencies, the\nsize of the antenna reduces drastically And since the 5G radios consume very low power,\nso these millimeter-wave radios can be even installed on the street lights. So, this is all about the 5G frequency bands. Now, let's briefly see the different technologies\nbehind 5G, which will enable the different services to the end-user. So, one of the main technology behind 5G is\nthe massive MIMO. So, here this MIMO stands for multiple inputs,\nmultiple outputs. where at both transmitters and the receiver,\nthe multiple antennas are installed. So, this MIMO is not a new concept. And even it was used in the previous generations\nlike in the fourth generation and even it is used in the WiFi technology. But in the case of the 5G, the scale at which\nthis concept is used is massive. So, this massive MIMO will enable spatial\ndiversity and spatial multiplexing. Spatial diversity means, using the same frequency\nand the time-slot, the same data can be sent over the different spatial paths. which will improve reliability and it will\nalso improve the data rate. Then in the case of the spatial multiplexing,\ndifferent data is sent to the user over the different spatial paths. which will increase the throughput to the\nend-user. Then another concept which is possible to\nachieve with this massive MIMO is the multi-user MIMO.\nwhere using the different spatial paths, different users can be served simultaneously over the\nsame frequency. So, with the help of this multi-user massive\nMIMO, it is possible to enhance the cell capacity. That is the number of users, which can be\nserved simultaneously. Now, this massive MIMO will also enable the\nuse of the beamforming technique. This beamforming is another key wireless technique,\nwhere a wireless signal is focused in a specific direction rather than broadcasting it in a\nwide area. So, to understand this beamforming, you can\nthink of it as a difference between the flashlight and the laser pointer. So, with the massive number of antennas in\nthe massive MIMO system, this beamforming will also become 3D beamforming. So, with this 3D beamforming, it is possible\nto serve and track the user whenever they are moving on the street. Or it is possible to track them whenever they\nare moving from one floor to another floor in the buildings. And having such narrow and the direct beam\nwill also help in reducing the interference with the other beams. So, these are the advantages of massive MIMO\ntechnology. Then the next important aspect is the network\nslicing. the network slicing is a specific form of\nvirtualization, which allows the multiple logical networks to run on top of shared physical\ninfrastructure. So, as discussed earlier, this 5G network\nshould be able to provide three types of basic services together. That is the Internet of Things, enhanced mobile\nbroadband, and very low latency communication. So, all these different types of services\nwill require a different quality of services as well as the different resources. For example, in the Internet of Things, a\nlarge number of devices are connected together, but the throughput of each device will be\nvery low. But to connect such a large number of devices,\nthe network should be capable enough. On the other end, if we see the case of very\nhigh-speed internet users, then their throughput will be very high. But the number of users will be less than\nIoT devices. So, using this network slicing, all the similar\ntypes of services can be served together using the logical network. which will not only increase service reliability,\nbut it will also increase the end-user experience. But all these different types of services\ncan be provided to the end-user when the entire architecture is based on the 5G network. But most of the current 5G deployment is on\ntop of the 4G architecture. So, basically, there are two 5G deployment\noptions. That is non-standalone and standalone 5G. In non-standalone 5G deployment, the core\nis still 4G core, but the base station or the new radios are the 5G based. So, in this non-standalone 5G, the 5G radios\nwill be used to provide fast data to the end-user. But for the control and the signaling, still,\nthe 4G architecture will be used. So, currently, most of the 5G deployment which\nis going in the world is based on this non-standalone 5G. So, in the first phase of the 5G deployment,\nthe focus is to provide faster internet speed to the end-users. The advantage of this non-standalone 5G is\nthat the existing 4G infrastructure can be used for the 5G deployment. But the true potential of the 5G can be experienced\nonly in the standalone 5G. where the core is based on the 5G architecture,\nand the new radios which are used in the 5G deployment are based on the millimeter-wave\nfrequencies. So, this network slicing and all other low\nlatency services can be provided to the end-user when the core is also 5G core. So, gradually, the mobile network operator\nwill move towards the standalone 5G, but it will take some time. So, even in the counties, where this 5G deployment\nis going on, it will take some time, to experience the true 5G features. So, that is all about the 5G deployment.

In this video, I\u2019ll show you some astonishing\naugmented reality apps for education. Make sure to check the description as I link\nto the blog post with lesson ideas using these exact apps. But first, what exactly is AR? Augmented reality or AR is a visual and sometimes\ninteractive experience in a real-world environment where the objects in the real world are \u201caugmented\u201d\nby computer-generated perceptual information. These virtual enhancements in the real world\ncan appear as something visual and auditory. Here are 8 augmented reality apps. I have 2 more for you via the link in the\ndescription. The first one is HP Reveal.\nThe idea of HP Reveal is simple: you make any image (a photo, graphics,\ntext document, \u2026) scannable with a smartphone or tablet, and associate an action to take\nwhen the image is scanned. An action can be: display a movie, show an\nextra explanation, refer to a website, etc. This way, you enrich simple paper posters,\nimages, QR-codes, and many more for people who use the Reveal app to look at them. The second AR app is CoSpaces edu.\nThis app is a content creation app for students. With CoSpaces, students can build their own\n3D objects and animate them with code. Students can explore any creations with the\nVR and AR view modes. The next app, Wonderscope is a storytelling\napp that uses augmented reality to transform ordinary places into realtime stories. Students also learn to read with the app. They ask questions to the characters in the\nstory and listen to the characters' answers. Use Shapes 3D for math, or more specifically,\nto teach geometry.

        "Transcript": "  [MUSIC PLAYING]   VALENTINE: As much\nas I wish I could say that I'm enjoying a\nnice vacation at the beach. I'm not. I'm here in Boston at MIT. So how did this\nlittle cardboard box make me feel like I'm miles\naway from where I actually am? How did it create\nvirtual reality? Now, if you open this little\nbox up, it's pretty simple. There's a place to put your\nphone in, and the rest of it look like glasses with\nthese two plastic lenses. Now it's this piece\nover here that's crucial to making me feel like\nI'm inside a video on my phone. It's what creates 3D vision. 3D vision is actually\npretty simple. We have two eyes that's\nabout three inches apart, and because of this\nseparation, each of our eyes the world from a slightly\ndifferent perspective. Our brain fuses those two views\nand creates a sense of depth. Hold out your thumb in front\nof you and close your left eye. Now try closing your right eye. Do you notice how your\nthumb jumps a little bit to the left or right when\nyou switch between your eyes? Now bring your thumb a\nlittle bit closer to you and do the same thing. It seems to jump\neven more, right? Depending on how close or\nfar you hold out your thumb, it'll jump more or less. Our brain gets a sense of how\nfar an object is depending on how different it appears from\nthe left versus the right eye, and that's 3D vision. Instead of one picture\ncovering the whole screen, this video has two\ndifferent images made for each eye that are\never so slightly offset. The cardboard box holds the\nimage in the perfect distance to my eyes and divides\nthe image into two so that each eye\nfocuses on the image. This type of video-- the\nstereoscopic display-- simulates what our eyes do\nnaturally and fools our brains into thinking that it's\nlooking at a 3D image by creating a sense of depth. But the cardboard in the video\ndo more than create 3D vision. When you move your head\naround, it actually reveals new areas of the video. The phone has a\ncouple of sensors that measures position and\nangle, sort of like a GPS, so it can track how\nyour head is moving and as you move\nyour head around, the images on the\nscreen adjust so that you feel like you're\nnot only looking at a video, but actually walking through it.   Now, if virtual reality\nis as easy as sliding a phone into a cardboard\nbox, why are we not all living in a\nvirtual world today? There's a couple of reasons. First, reality is more\nthan just what we see. If I really want to feel\nlike I'm at the beach, what are some other elements\nthat I would add in? The feeling of sand between your\ntoes, the smell of salt water, the sound of wind. Exactly. But these are things\nthat are harder to make virtual than vision. Things like haptics,\nthe science of touch, will help us to better\nunderstand our real senses in order to simulate\nthem in virtual reality. By the way, simulating these\nother senses, like taste, smell, or touch,\nwill eventually help us to improve motion sickness,\nwhich a lot of people feel in virtual reality today. Also, to create a fully\nimmersive environment, even if it's just\nvisual, is a lot of work. It's way more than\njust filming a scene from two different perspectives\nto create 3D vision. You need to create and capture\nan entire three-dimensional world where you can walk\naround and move your head to see all the possible views. Several companies are developing\nspecial software and cameras, but it's still very\nexpensive and time-consuming to do this at high quality. Virtual reality is\nreally cool, but even if it can create a\nperfect virtual reality, we wouldn't want it to\nreplace actual reality. We still like to experience some\nthings in real life, like snow. And as a society, we\nare just beginning to think about the ethical\nand moral aspect of creating simulated realities. So virtual reality\nmay look simple, but it's very complicated. The cool thing is that the\nbetter understanding we have of real reality, like\nhow our senses work, the better virtual\nreality we'll get.  ",

        "Transcript": "Future of Space Travel: Timelapse of\u00a0\nSpacecraft Advancements (2025 - 4000) The great scientist Carl Sagan once said\u00a0\nthat \u201c...in the long run, every planetary\u00a0\u00a0 civilization will be endangered by impacts from\u00a0\nspace, [therefore] every surviving civilization is\u00a0\u00a0 obliged to become spacefaring\u2026\u201d So, if the destiny\u00a0\nof humanity lies in conquering space, we must\u00a0\u00a0 carefully consider the spaceships of the future\u00a0\nthat will get us there. Join us as we unravel the\u00a0\u00a0 mysteries and possibilities of future spacecraft,\u00a0\ntaking you on a voyage through the corridors of\u00a0\u00a0 the cosmos from the near future to the Year 4000.\n2025\u00a0 SpaceX in collaboration with NASA and Blue Origin\u00a0\nlaunches the first next-generation electric ion\u00a0\u00a0 engines. These engines work by ionizing a gas\u00a0\n(like xenon), creating positively charged ions\u00a0\u00a0 which are accelerated by an electric field\u00a0\ninside the engine and expelled at high speeds,\u00a0\u00a0 generating thrust. The process is highly efficient\u00a0\nbut provides low thrust, making it suitable for\u00a0\u00a0 long-duration space missions, facilitating the\u00a0\nreduction of travel times between celestial\u00a0\u00a0 bodies. Reusable rocket technology becomes the\u00a0\nnorm rather than the exception. SpaceX's Falcon\u00a0\u00a0 9 and Falcon Heavy lead the charge, with routine\u00a0\nlaunches and landings drastically reducing the\u00a0\u00a0 cost of access to space and establishing a robust\u00a0\necosystem for low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond.\u00a0 2029\nReusable vehicles equipped\u00a0\u00a0 with state-of-the-art heat shield technologies are\u00a0\ndeveloped. These spacecraft feature robust thermal\u00a0\u00a0 protection systems capable of withstanding\u00a0\nthe extreme temperatures encountered during\u00a0\u00a0 re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. With the Artemis\u00a0\nprogram in full swing, the Moon emerges as a focal\u00a0\u00a0 point for human exploration, and we herald the\u00a0\nestablishment of permanent lunar habitats led\u00a0\u00a0 by NASA in collaboration with Blue Origin and\u00a0\nother international partners. These companies\u00a0\u00a0 establish lunar outposts that not only help us\u00a0\nto mine lunar resources such as water ice and\u00a0\u00a0 rare minerals but serve as bases for scientific\u00a0\nresearch, manufacturing, and refueling stations\u00a0\u00a0 for further space exploration missions.\n2030\u00a0 NASA initiates the deployment of fundamental\u00a0\ncomponents for an orbiting fuel station,\u00a0\u00a0 facilitating spacecraft refueling and\u00a0\nmaintenance directly in Earth's orbit,\u00a0\u00a0 eliminating the necessity for spacecraft to\u00a0\nreturn to the surface. This enables extended\u00a0\u00a0 mission durations, reduced reliance on Earth's\u00a0\nresources, and increased operational flexibility\u00a0\u00a0 for spacecraft operating in space, fostering\u00a0\na sustainable and economically viable space\u00a0\u00a0 ecosystem.\n2032\u00a0 The cosmos becomes a construction site\u00a0\nas in-orbit assembly techniques\u2014which are\u00a0\u00a0 methods for constructing structures,\u00a0\nsuch as space stations or habitats,\u00a0\u00a0 directly in space\u2014revolutionize the development\u00a0\nof large-scale space stations and habitats. This\u00a0\u00a0 leads to the construction of modular structures\u00a0\nthat can be assembled piece by piece in space,\u00a0\u00a0 lowering the logistical difficulties involved in\u00a0\nlaunching pre-built structures and opening the\u00a0\u00a0 door to the development of expansive habitats that\u00a0\ncan support human habitation for lengthy periods\u00a0\u00a0 of time. These customizable configurations\u00a0\nalso allow for spacecraft to be tailored\u00a0\u00a0 precisely to the unique requirements of each\u00a0\nmission and payload. By employing standardized\u00a0\u00a0 interfaces and interchangeable modules, spacecraft\u00a0\ndesigners can rapidly assemble and reconfigure\u00a0\u00a0 vessels to meet evolving scientific,\u00a0\ncommercial, and exploration objectives.\u00a0 2033\nDeployment of\u00a0\u00a0 swarms of microsatellites for detailed mapping\u00a0\nand monitoring of celestial bodies, enabling\u00a0\u00a0 precise navigation and resource identification for\u00a0\nfuture missions. These advanced microsatellites\u00a0\u00a0 are equipped with cutting-edge sensors and imaging\u00a0\nsystems capable of capturing high-resolution data,\u00a0\u00a0 facilitating precise navigation and comprehensive\u00a0\nresource identification for forthcoming missions.\u00a0\u00a0 Leveraging sophisticated onboard processing\u00a0\ncapabilities, these microsatellite swarms\u00a0\u00a0 autonomously analyze data in real time, enabling\u00a0\nrapid decision-making and enhancing mission\u00a0\u00a0 efficiency.\n2034\u00a0 The initial testing of small-scale nuclear fusion\u00a0\npropulsion systems. Tri Alpha Energy and General\u00a0\u00a0 Fusion collaborate with space agencies to develop\u00a0\ncompact fusion reactors capable of producing\u00a0\u00a0 abundant, clean energy for spacecraft propulsion\u00a0\nsystems. These systems work by fusing light atomic\u00a0\u00a0 nuclei to release vast amounts of energy,\u00a0\ngenerating thrust on an unprecedented scale.\u00a0\u00a0 These propulsion systems, not only have reduced\u00a0\ninterplanetary transit times but also increased\u00a0\u00a0 payload capacities and extended mission durations.\u00a0\nThese systems rely on isotopes of hydrogen,\u00a0\u00a0 abundant in resources throughout the universe, as\u00a0\nfuel sources, and are therefore more sustainable.\u00a0 2035\nMars colonization efforts intensify. During\u00a0\u00a0 the perihelic opposition, when Mars is closest\u00a0\nto the Earth in its orbit, SpaceX's Starship,\u00a0\u00a0 equipped with advanced life support systems\u00a0\nand radiation shielding, begins transporting\u00a0\u00a0 settlers to Mars. Collaborative efforts between\u00a0\nspace agencies and private companies lead to\u00a0\u00a0 the construction of Mars habitats using on-site\u00a0\nresources that significantly reduce the cost and\u00a0\u00a0 logistical challenges of colonization. Asteroid\u00a0\nmining emerges as a viable and economically\u00a0\u00a0 feasible industry, leveraging in-situ resource\u00a0\nutilization (ISRU) techniques. Space-faring\u00a0\u00a0 companies begin to deploy robotic spacecraft\u00a0\nto near-Earth asteroids rich in precious metals\u00a0\u00a0 and rare minerals. Advanced autonomous mining\u00a0\ntechniques are employed to extract resources,\u00a0\u00a0 which are then transported back to Earth or used\u00a0\nfor in-space manufacturing. Hey guys, we did a\u00a0\u00a0 video about the timelapse of first 10,000 days of\u00a0\nmars colonization, be sure to check it out! 2040\u00a0 The launch of the first interstellar probes,\u00a0\npropelled by fusion-powered engines. These\u00a0\u00a0 probes, equipped with advanced sensors and\u00a0\ncommunication systems, set out to explore\u00a0\u00a0 nearby star systems and their exoplanets.\u00a0\nBreakthrough initiatives like Breakthrough\u00a0\u00a0 Starshot aim to send nanocrafts to Alpha\u00a0\nCentauri at a fraction of the speed of light.\u00a0 2042\nWith the deployment of autonomous\u00a0\u00a0 spacecraft maintenance drones, the cosmos becomes\u00a0\na self-sustaining ecosystem. Emerging from a\u00a0\u00a0 collaboration between Northrop Grumman and the\u00a0\nEuropean Space Agency, these robotic assistants\u00a0\u00a0 perform intricate repairs and inspections on\u00a0\norbiting spacecraft and infrastructure. They\u00a0\u00a0 come equipped with advanced tools and guided by\u00a0\nsophisticated AI algorithms which enable them to\u00a0\u00a0 conduct precise operations in the unforgiving\u00a0\nenvironment of space and ensure the continued\u00a0\u00a0 functionality and safety of critical space assets.\n2045\u00a0 Artificial intelligence takes center stage aboard\u00a0\nspacecraft, completely revolutionizing navigation\u00a0\u00a0 and control systems with unprecedented levels\u00a0\nof autonomy, decision-making capabilities, and\u00a0\u00a0 capacity to adapt to the rigors of long-duration\u00a0\nmissions across the solar system. The integration\u00a0\u00a0 of AI algorithms into spacecraft avionics enhances\u00a0\nreliability, safety, and autonomy in space\u00a0\u00a0 missions. It also enables fault detection,\u00a0\nautonomous navigation, adaptive control,\u00a0\u00a0 predictive maintenance, and risk assessment,\u00a0\neffectively reducing reliance on ground controls.\u00a0 2046\nNanotechnology is integrated\u00a0\u00a0 into spacecraft maintenance and repair at the\u00a0\nmolecular level. Nanobots, equipped with advanced\u00a0\u00a0 sensors and tools, navigate spacecraft surfaces,\u00a0\nidentifying and repairing structural damages\u00a0\u00a0 with unparalleled precision. These nanobots\u00a0\noperate autonomously, executing intricate repair\u00a0\u00a0 tasks without the need for human intervention,\u00a0\neffectively eliminating the need for expensive\u00a0\u00a0 and risky maintenance missions. Swarm intelligence\u00a0\nalgorithms for autonomous spacecraft coordination\u00a0\u00a0 and collaboration are deployed, enabling complex\u00a0\nmissions with distributed decision-making\u00a0\u00a0 capabilities. This is followed by the development\u00a0\nof gravitational wave propulsion systems for\u00a0\u00a0 efficient and low-energy interstellar travel,\u00a0\nas well as the integration of virtual reality\u00a0\u00a0 and telepresence technologies for immersive\u00a0\nexploration and remote operation of robotic probes\u00a0\u00a0 and rovers across planetary surfaces.\n2047\u00a0 Development of adaptive spacecraft skins capable\u00a0\nof dynamically adjusting thermal properties and\u00a0\u00a0 surface characteristics in response to changing\u00a0\nenvironmental conditions. These skins incorporate\u00a0\u00a0 smart materials and microfluidic channels that\u00a0\nregulate heat exchange and surface morphology. As\u00a0\u00a0 temperatures fluctuate or encounter varying levels\u00a0\nof radiation, these skins automatically adjust,\u00a0\u00a0 optimizing thermal insulation or dissipation\u00a0\nand altering surface properties for enhanced\u00a0\u00a0 protection or maneuverability. With such adaptive\u00a0\ncapabilities, optimal performance and durability\u00a0\u00a0 of spacecraft across diverse mission profiles,\u00a0\nfrom orbiting in extreme heat to traversing icy\u00a0\u00a0 celestial bodies, is ensured.\n2048\u00a0 Self-healing materials and cutting-edge\u00a0\n3D printing technologies are integrated\u00a0\u00a0 into spacecraft systems to enable in-situ\u00a0\nrepairs and component replacement. The former\u00a0\u00a0 consists of materials that are designed\u00a0\nto autonomously mend structural damages\u00a0\u00a0 caused by micrometeoroid impacts and wear over\u00a0\ntime while the latter allows for the on-demand\u00a0\u00a0 fabrication of spare parts and intricate\u00a0\ncomponents directly aboard the spacecraft.\u00a0 2049\nLife support systems\u00a0\u00a0 employing closed-loop recycling technologies are\u00a0\nintroduced alongside advanced synthetic biology\u00a0\u00a0 techniques for on-board food production and\u00a0\nrecycling. These cutting-edge systems minimize\u00a0\u00a0 the need for resupply missions by efficiently\u00a0\nrecycling air, water, and waste within confined\u00a0\u00a0 spacecraft environments, achieving a synergistic\u00a0\nintegration of biological and mechanical processes\u00a0\u00a0 that create regenerative ecosystems capable\u00a0\nof supporting extended crewed missions to\u00a0\u00a0 distant celestial bodies. Quantum communication\u00a0\nnetworks, utilizing entangled photon pairs for\u00a0\u00a0 secure information transfer safeguard space-based\u00a0\nassets against cyber threats and interference.\u00a0 2051\nThe pressing necessity for robust asteroid defense\u00a0\u00a0 mechanisms becomes increasingly evident amidst the\u00a0\nestablishment of colonies on Earth, the Moon, and\u00a0\u00a0 Mars. Innovative trials are currently underway,\u00a0\ncentering on the implementation of propulsion\u00a0\u00a0 systems directly onto asteroids to facilitate\u00a0\ncontrolled alterations in their trajectories.\u00a0\u00a0 These groundbreaking initiatives signify a pivotal\u00a0\nstride forward in fortifying our extraterrestrial\u00a0\u00a0 settlements against the looming threat of\u00a0\ncatastrophic asteroid impacts, safeguarding the\u00a0\u00a0 future of humanity's expansion into the cosmos.\n2053\u00a0 Spacecraft design incorporates gravitational\u00a0\nmanipulation technologies to mitigate the\u00a0\u00a0 negative physiological consequences of extended\u00a0\nweightlessness on crew members' health. Spacecraft\u00a0\u00a0 can replicate gravity by integrating sophisticated\u00a0\ngravitational field manipulation devices, which\u00a0\u00a0 lowers the dangers involved in long-term space\u00a0\nmissions. Spacecraft are designed with rotating\u00a0\u00a0 habitats, where artificial gravity is produced by\u00a0\nthe centrifugal forces of rotation. These rotating\u00a0\u00a0 habitats use centrifugal force to simulate the\u00a0\neffects of gravity by revolving around a central\u00a0\u00a0 axis in the form of concentric rings or modules.\u00a0\nGravitational manipulation devices are used by\u00a0\u00a0 spacecraft to create localized gravitational\u00a0\nfields within designated zones, which enables\u00a0\u00a0 crew members to exercise and carry out duties in\u00a0\nsurroundings with different gravity levels. For\u00a0\u00a0 crewed missions to distant exoplanets, hibernation\u00a0\nand suspended animation technologies are developed\u00a0\u00a0 to reduce metabolic demands.\n2055\u00a0 The advent of antimatter propulsion\u00a0\nand interstellar ramjets. Antimatter\u00a0\u00a0 propulsion harnesses matter-antimatter\u00a0\nreactions for unparalleled thrust,\u00a0\u00a0 enabling spacecraft to achieve significant\u00a0\nfractions of the speed of light. Meanwhile,\u00a0\u00a0 interstellar ramjets utilize magnetic fields to\u00a0\ncompress interstellar hydrogen as a propellant,\u00a0\u00a0 propelling spacecraft to relativistic speeds and\u00a0\noffering the tantalizing prospect of reaching\u00a0\u00a0 distant stars within human lifetimes.\n2065\u00a0 Advanced radiation shielding materials and\u00a0\ntechnologies are developed to protect spacecraft\u00a0\u00a0 and crew from the hazards of deep space travel\u00a0\nduring long-duration missions beyond Earth's\u00a0\u00a0 magnetosphere. Collaborative efforts between\u00a0\naerospace engineers, materials scientists,\u00a0\u00a0 and medical experts yield robust shielding\u00a0\nsolutions capable of deflecting and absorbing\u00a0\u00a0 cosmic radiation with unprecedented efficiency.\u00a0\nInnovative materials such as graphene-based\u00a0\u00a0 composites and meta-materials are utilized as\u00a0\nspacecraft designers seek ways to fortify vessel\u00a0\u00a0 hulls against the relentless onslaught of cosmic\u00a0\nrays, further ensuring the safety and well-being\u00a0\u00a0 of crew members throughout extended voyages.\n2071\u00a0 The establishment of space-based manufacturing\u00a0\nfacilities transforms the production of materials\u00a0\u00a0 and spacecraft components in orbit, turning the\u00a0\nuniverse into a veritable industrial furnace.\u00a0\u00a0 These orbital factories, driven by innovative\u00a0\nfirms, use in-situ resource utilization (ISRU)\u00a0\u00a0 and advanced additive manufacturing processes\u00a0\nto produce materials and complex structures with\u00a0\u00a0 unmatched accuracy and productivity. Space-based\u00a0\nmanufacturing facilities significantly lower\u00a0\u00a0 launch costs and logistical complexity while\u00a0\nsimultaneously enhancing mission flexibility\u00a0\u00a0 and scalability by removing the limitations\u00a0\nimposed by Earth's gravity and atmosphere.\u00a0 2075\nThe emergence\u00a0\u00a0 of biomimetic designs, which draw inspiration\u00a0\nfrom nature, brings about a fundamental change\u00a0\u00a0 in spaceship engineering. These cutting-edge\u00a0\nspaceship concepts maximize performance in harsh\u00a0\u00a0 settings like vacuum and microgravity by taking\u00a0\ninspiration from the adaptability and efficiency\u00a0\u00a0 seen in biological creatures. Spacecraft\u00a0\ncan achieve increased structural integrity,\u00a0\u00a0 simplified energy consumption, and superior\u00a0\naerodynamic profiles by mimicking the solutions\u00a0\u00a0 found in nature. Biomimetic materials, which\u00a0\nimitate the characteristics of natural materials,\u00a0\u00a0 help spacecraft remain durable and\u00a0\nadaptable in a hostile cosmic environment.\u00a0 2080\nThe dream of rapid interstellar\u00a0\u00a0 travel becomes a reality with the integration\u00a0\nof advanced propulsion systems, including warp\u00a0\u00a0 drives and wormhole generators, into spacecraft\u00a0\ndesigns. Inspired by the theoretical frameworks of\u00a0\u00a0 Alcubierre and Thorne, visionary researchers and\u00a0\nengineers embark on a quest to harness the fabric\u00a0\u00a0 of spacetime itself, bending it to their will in\u00a0\npursuit of cosmic exploration and colonization.\u00a0\u00a0 Through innovative applications of exotic\u00a0\nmatter and energy, spacecraft equipped with\u00a0\u00a0 warp drives and wormhole generators traverse the\u00a0\nvast distances between stars in mere fractions of\u00a0\u00a0 the time previously thought possible, opening up a\u00a0\nuniverse of possibilities for humanity's expansion\u00a0\u00a0 into the cosmos. As the cosmic horizon beckons\u00a0\nwith newfound allure, humanity stands on the\u00a0\u00a0 threshold of a new age of interstellar adventure,\u00a0\npropelled by the boundless potential of advanced\u00a0\u00a0 propulsion technologies.\n2091\u00a0 Advanced propulsion systems, such as wormhole\u00a0\ngenerators and warp motors, are incorporated into\u00a0\u00a0 spaceship architecture to enable fast interstellar\u00a0\ntravel. Motivated by novel theoretical frameworks\u00a0\u00a0 developed by Alcubierre and Thorne, scientists\u00a0\nand engineers set out to harness spacetime itself\u00a0\u00a0 and bend it to their will. Wormholes, which\u00a0\nare hypothetical tunnels through spacetime\u00a0\u00a0 that connect distant points in the universe,\u00a0\nare used to traverse vast distances in space\u00a0\u00a0 almost instantaneously, effectively bypassing the\u00a0\nlimitations of propulsion methods. Warp drives\u00a0\u00a0 compress spacetime in front of a spacecraft while\u00a0\nexpanding it behind and by doing so it effectively\u00a0\u00a0 creates a \"warp bubble\" that would allow the\u00a0\nspacecraft to ride a wave of warped spacetime.\u00a0\u00a0 Within the warp bubble, the spacecraft itself\u00a0\nwould not be moving at speeds faster than light,\u00a0\u00a0 but instead, it would be carried along by\u00a0\nthe expansion of spacetime, allowing for FTL\u00a0\u00a0 travel without violating Einstein's theory of\u00a0\nrelativity. Spacecraft fitted with warp drives\u00a0\u00a0 and wormhole generators travel the vast distances\u00a0\nbetween stars in a fraction of the time previously\u00a0\u00a0 believed possible.\n3100\u00a0 With the development of fleets of self-replicating\u00a0\nspaceships designed to proliferate independently\u00a0\u00a0 and adjust to the difficulties of interstellar\u00a0\ntravel, the furthest reaches of the universe are\u00a0\u00a0 within humanity's grasp. These self-replicating\u00a0\nprobes, equipped with highly advanced artificial\u00a0\u00a0 intelligence and utilizing state-of-the-art\u00a0\nnanotechnology, embark on autonomous exploration\u00a0\u00a0 and colonization missions to far-off star\u00a0\nsystems. Each spaceship in the fleet is capable\u00a0\u00a0 of replicating itself using raw materials found\u00a0\nin space. The artificial intelligence systems\u00a0\u00a0 onboard these probes continuously adapt\u00a0\nand optimize their navigation, propulsion,\u00a0\u00a0 and resource utilization strategies, while\u00a0\nthe nanotechnology employed allows for precise\u00a0\u00a0 manipulation of matter at the molecular level,\u00a0\nfacilitating efficient construction, repair,\u00a0\u00a0 and adaptation of spacecraft components\u00a0\nwhile en route to distant destinations.\u00a0 3600\nQuantum propulsion system developments further\u00a0\u00a0 transform interstellar travel. These systems\u00a0\nharness the principles of quantum entanglement,\u00a0\u00a0 superposition, and tunneling for instantaneous\u00a0\npropulsion. Quantum entanglement works by\u00a0\u00a0 linking the states of particles regardless of\u00a0\ndistance, enabling instantaneous communication\u00a0\u00a0 and propulsion across vast distances. This\u00a0\nphenomenon allows spacecraft to bypass the\u00a0\u00a0 constraints of traditional propulsion methods\u00a0\nreliant on relativistic travel. Meanwhile, quantum\u00a0\u00a0 tunneling exploits the ability of particles to\u00a0\npenetrate energy barriers, facilitating rapid\u00a0\u00a0 transit between distant star systems by navigating\u00a0\nthrough spacetime barriers. With quantum-enabled\u00a0\u00a0 spacecraft networks spanning the galaxy, humanity\u00a0\nis on the verge of colonizing the entire universe.\u00a0 4000\nHumanity\u00a0\u00a0 has achieved the capability to explore parallel\u00a0\nuniverses and alternate dimensions, facilitated\u00a0\u00a0 by propulsion systems capable of manipulating\u00a0\nspacetime, quantum sensors for detecting subtle\u00a0\u00a0 phenomena across universes, hyperdimensional\u00a0\nnavigation systems for mapping higher-dimensional\u00a0\u00a0 spaces, and interdimensional communication\u00a0\ntechnologies based on quantum entanglement.\u00a0\u00a0 This represents the culmination of humanity's\u00a0\ndeep understanding of reality and the development\u00a0\u00a0 of sophisticated spacefaring capabilities.\nWhat technological advancement are you most\u00a0\u00a0 excited about for humanity's future in space?

These are some of the eternal questions associated\nwith astronomy that continue to pique human imagination from ancient times to the present\nday. Astronomy is the science that has as its main\npurpose the determination of the positions, dimensions and movements of the celestial\nbodies. So in this video we are going to talk about\nsomething magnificent that will help us understand the humanity\u2019s perception over the years\nabout astronomy. Let\u2019s analyze and get deep into the history\nof astronomy. Astronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences\nand powerfully associated with religious, cosmological, and astrological beliefs. The first astronomers were the ones who could\ndistinguish the planets and the stars due to the fact that they were the first ones\nthat made observations and predictions. Before we continue with our exploration to\nthe history of Astronomy, be sure to like or dislike the video so that we can continue\nimprove and make these videos better for you the viewer. Plus, be sure to subscribe to the channel\nso that you don\u2019t miss any of our weekly videos! From the beginning humanity turned its eyes\nto the sky full of awe and questions. The sunrise and sunset of the Sun, the phases\nof the Moon, the alternation of seasons, the movement of other planets in the sky, the\nappearance of comets and the shocking phenomenon of eclipses, were the first evidence that\nthere is something above that needs to be discovered. That is how astronomy started to develop. These incidents raised our curiosity and made\nus wonder what are they? Where do they come from? We do know today but imagine in those days\u2026\nthey were like Gods. As early as the 6th century BCE, ancient Greek\nphilosophers documented evidence that Earth was a sphere. They noted that the night sky looked different\nwhen seen from various locations on Earth, hinting at our planet's curved surface. They also observed the round shadow of Earth\non the Moon during lunar eclipses. These philosophers were even able to calculate\nthe circumference of Earth quite accurately. They did this by measuring the length of the\nshadow cast by an object at exactly the same time, in two different locations. Taking into account the distance between those\ntwo locations and the difference in the lengths of the shadows, they calculated that Earth's\ncircumference was about 46,250 kilometres. That is very close to the real value of 40,075\nkilometres! In the year 185, Chinese astronomers became\nthe first to document a supernova. Several supernova explosions have been observed\nsince then, including a particularly bright one in the year 1054, which (at its peak)\nwas four times brighter than planet Venus, one of the brightest objects in the night\nsky. Some supernovae are even bright enough to\nbe visible during the day! The notion that our own galaxy \u2013 the Milky\nWay \u2013 is but one of trillions of other galaxies in the universe only dates back about a century. Before then, nearby galaxies were thought\nto be cloudy regions of the Milky Way. The first documented observation of the neighbouring\nAndromeda Galaxy was in the year 964 by a Persian astronomer who described it as a \"nebulous\nsmear.\" For centuries, it was simply known in star\ncharts as the \"Little Cloud.\" Before the 16th century, Earth was commonly\nthought to be at the centre of the solar system, with all other celestial objects revolving\naround it. This is known as the geocentric model. This theory, however, did not match some confusing\nobservations made by astronomers, such as the path of planets that appeared to move\nbackwards on their orbits. In 1543, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus\nproposed a heliocentric model of the solar system in which the planets orbit the Sun. This model explained the unusual path of planets\nthat astronomers had observed. The new theory was one of many revolutionary\nideas about astronomy that emerged during the Renaissance period. The work of astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes\nKepler led to an accurate description of planetary motions and laid the foundation for Isaac\nNewton's theory of gravitation. This progress dramatically improved humanity's\nunderstanding of the universe. Their observations and investigations were\nstrengthened by the invention of the telescope in the early 17th century. Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei popularized\nthe use of telescopes to study and discover celestial objects, including Jupiter's four\nbiggest moons. In his honour, they are known as the Galilean\nmoons. Throughout the years we have found ancient\nmonuments of astronomical interest that are about 5,000 years old. For instance the pyramids of Egypt and the\nmegalithic Stonehenge monument in England have an astronomical orientation so that they\nare connected to various astronomical phenomena. The orientation of the pyramids shows, for\nexample, that the Egyptians knew some basic addresses in space, used by astronomers. It's also known that they've been using a\ncalendar since 4,000 BC. So this means that they were well aware of\nthe phases of the Moon and the movement of the Sun in the ecliptic. A significant factor to our knowledge of the\nUniverse plays the Greek Astronomy. The breakthrough that gave Greek astronomy\nits own particular character was the application of geometry to cosmic problems. The oldest extant source that clearly states\nthat Earth is a sphere and that gives a sound argument to support the claim is Aristotle\u2019s\nOn the Heavens. Aristotle mentioned that Earth\u2019s shadow\nas seen on the Moon during a lunar eclipse is circular. He also mentioned the changes that occur in\nthe stars that are visible as one moves from north to south on Earth. Aristotle claimed that certain mathematicians\nhad contrived to measure Earth\u2019s circumference and had found a value of 400,000 stades. Also in the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of\nSamos applied geometrical reasoning to estimate the distances of the Sun and the Moon, in\nOn the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon. However, his initial premises included several\nquestionable numerical values. For example, he assumed that at the moment\nof quarter Moon, the angle between the Sun and the Moon, as observed from Earth, is 87\u00b0. From this it followed that the Sun\u2019s distance\nis about 19 times the Moon\u2019s distance from us. (The actual ratio is about 389.) A second doubtful observation was that the\nangular size of the Sun or the Moon is 2\u00b0. Another of Hipparchus\u2019s contributions was\nthe discovery of precession, the slow eastward motion of the stars around the zodiac caused\nby wobbling, over a period of 25,772 years, in the orientation of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation. Hipparchus\u2019s writings on this subject have\nnot survived, but his ideas can be reconstructed from summaries given by Ptolemy. Hipparchus used observations of several fixed\nstars, taken with respect to the eclipsed Moon, which had been made by some of his predecessors. On comparing these with eclipse observations\nhe had made himself, he deduced that the fixed stars move eastward not less than 1\u00b0 in 100\nyears. The Babylonians, in their theories, revised\ntheir locations of the equinoxes and solstices. For example, in one version of the Babylonian\ntheory, the spring equinox is said to occur at the 10th degree of Aries; in another version,\nat the 8th degree. Some historians have maintained that this\nreflects a Babylonian awareness of precession, on which Hipparchus might have drawn. Other historians have argued that the evidence\nis not clear and that these differing norms for the equinox may represent nothing more\nthan alternative conventions. It is important to mention Galileo. A famous Greek scientist that contributed\nto the knowledge we have today for our universe. He is well known for his telescope. Galileo, through his telescope that is the\nfirst of all humans, in 1609, observed the mountains and valleys of the Moon, the stellar\nnature of our galaxy, the sunspots, the planet Saturn with its ring but mainly the phases\nof Venus and the four satellites of Jupiter. His unique observations radically changed\nthe worldview of his time. A heliocentric follower of Nicholas Copernicus,\nhe realized that on the one hand the phases of Venus, which showed that this planet orbits\nthe Sun, and on the other the four satellites of Jupiter, which has since been called the\nGalilean, provided the solution. The Moon was not the only case. There were other celestial bodies orbiting\na planet. Their existence forever destroyed the belief\nthat all celestial bodies revolved around the Earth. Our little planet, with all that that entailed,\nhas ceased to be the center of the Universe. Combining mathematics with physics, Galileo\nrejected the existence of the perishable sublunary and the indestructible crystalline supermoon\nworld, proving that the same laws govern and apply throughout the Universe, thus expanding\nthe limits of our visible then. In the same year, 1609, the genius astronomer\nJohannes Kepler, the legislator of our solar system, published a book in Heidelberg called\nAstronomia nova. And indeed it was News, as it recorded the\nfirst two laws of the motion of the planets and discovered, the first of all the astronomers\nof all time, the elliptical orbits of Mars and the other planets around the Sun. Influenced by Copernicus and his teacher,\nMichael Maistlin, a heliocentric, he relied on the accurate, long-term, and credible observations\nof the great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe and gave the laws that have ruled the planet\nsince then. It was amazing that this mystical and religious\nman overcame, overcame his fears and hesitations, and uprooted the Earth from its central position\nand the planets from their circular orbits. The first law says that the planets erase\naround the Sun elliptical orbits of which the Sun holds, while its second law shows\nus that in equal times they are erased from the planet equal areas. That is, the Sun remains still and occupies\none outbreak of ellipse, while the planet, when it moves along its elliptical orbit,\nscans at equal intervals equal areas inside the ellipse and not equal arcs on its perimeter. Unprecedented discoveries that laid the foundations\nof modern Astronomy and made Kepler a legislator of the solar system\nAs you can see, this was just the beginning. Thanks to the construction of perfect telescopes,\nastronomers have slowly managed to reconstruct the history of the Universe. What is certain is that astronomy's progress\nover the last 400 years has provided answers to questions from millennia, putting an end\nto all sorts of superstitions and superstitions. A huge contribution to the building of human\ncivilization. Eclipses are no longer but mere alignments\nand additions of celestial bodies and comets, these mysterious visitors from the depths\nof the vast Universe, are unburned celestial bodies, some \"dirty snowballs\", as the famous\nastrophysicist Fred Whipple describes them, as early as 1950. Babylonian astronomers in the first and second\nmillennia BCE tracked five points of light in the night sky that moved differently than\nthe other stars did. They concluded that something fundamentally\ndifferent existed: these five points of light were not stars at all. Historians and astronomers now believe the\nBabylonians were among the first to recognize the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,\nand Saturn, which become visible to the naked eye at different times of the year. Today, astronomers collect data about celestial\nobjects by using huge telescopes on the ground as well as in space.For example in 1923, Edwin\nHubble fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe when he used the 2.5\nm-diameter Hooker telescope to prove that the Andromeda Nebula extends beyond our Milky\nWay Galaxy. Hubble's discovery of the universe's ongoing\nexpansion also paved the way for other astronomers to theorize its origin. The big bang theory, first proposed by Georges\nLema\u00eetre, was later bolstered by strong evidence: the discovery of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB), faint \"noise\" left over from the massive explosion that gave rise to everything in\nthe universe. The CMB was accidentally discovered by radio\nastronomers just five years before the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. These modern telescopes equipped with massive\nmirrors allow astronomers to capture the light of very faint and faraway objects. Specialized techniques and sensitive scientific\ninstruments have been developed to study not only visible light, but also the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum of light including infrared light, radio waves and X-rays. Large, complex telescopes and advanced techniques\nhave even enabled astronomers to directly observe phenomena including black holes, distant\nexoplanets, and gravitational waves. Improvements in satellite launch and design\nallowed astronomers to collect even more data about planets within our solar system in the\nsecond half of the 20th century. Several robotic space probe campaigns, including\nMariner, Venera, and Voyager, ventured farther than ever before\nThanks for watching everyone!

        "Transcript": "Someday in the near future, you might be\nwandering around town at night when out of the\nblue you\u2019ll stumble across a robot. If that happens, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be\ntoo surprised. Not so long ago, robots were mostly found\nin the realms of science fiction. Today, they\u2019re vacuuming floors, building\ncars, and even roaming the surface of Mars. Robots are still pretty far from having a human level\ncapacity of intelligence, or even dexterity for that matter, but they\u2019re already a big part of many\nbranches of engineering. In the US, over a hundred thousand robots\nhave been added to factory floors since 2010. Knowing what exactly robots are, what they\ncan do and how they work is more important\nthan you might think. Because soon, they might be living among us. [Theme Music] The classic picture of a robot is something\nwith human-like intelligence, and maybe even\na humanoid appearance. But like so much else, real-life robots aren\u2019t\nmuch like what you usually see on TV. Robots come in all shapes and sizes, and\nthey can be built very differently depending\non what they\u2019re used for. For example, some of the robots used in mining\nare made from a camera, mounted on a small \nchassis with wheels. That allows them to enter and inspect mine\nshafts, and even retrieve leftover material from\nplaces it\u2019s hard to get people in and out of. Meanwhile, in medicine, specialized robotic\narms, with a bit of human assistance, can perform\nprecise surgeries through the tiniest incisions. There\u2019s also a difference between robotics\nand artificial intelligence, or AI, which\npeople sometimes confuse. While some of the concepts are similar,\nrobotics deals with a specific set of ideas,\nalthough it does borrow a few from AI. AI deals broadly with the goal of automating\ndecision-making for complex tasks \u2013 the kind\nyou can\u2019t write a simple set of rules for. That could be everything from playing chess\nto driving cars. Right now, AI systems tend to have very narrow\ngoals. But the holy grail of AI is to develop a system\nthat can make intelligent decisions about any sort\nof task using different sources of information. Our focus will be on robots, which are designed\nfor more specific purposes in the physical world. In engineering terms, a robot is a machine\ndesigned to interact with its environment, make an\nappropriate decision based on those surroundings, and then carry out the jobs related to its\ngoal, all automatically. Which means a true robot doesn\u2019t require\na human controlling exactly what it does. In general, the field of robotics also deals\nwith machines that do all of the same things, but might require a human operator to carry\nout some tasks. Whether fully automatic or not, virtually\nall robots have a few features in common. First, robots are machines made from\nmaterials that occupy physical space, so they\u2019re\nmore than just lines of computer code. That\u2019s one of the key features that distinguishes\nthem from an AI, although computer engineering\nis important for robots as well. Second, most robots have some way of sensing\nfeatures of their environment, usually by measuring\nlight, sound, or force feedback. They can then use that information to make\na decision about what to do next, depending\non what they\u2019re designed for. The tasks robots are built for tend to be\ncomplex, requiring a sequence of different\nmotions. So an automatic door that opens or shuts in\nresponse to whether you stand in front of a\nsensor wouldn\u2019t be considered a robot. The tasks that robots handle are more\nsophisticated, like welding two intricately-shaped\npieces of metal together. Third, to interpret the signals they receive from their environment and coordinate some sort of response, robots have computers built somewhere into their design. These work just like any computer, taking\ninputs and delivering outputs. But unlike most ordinary software, the software on\na robot\u2019s computer generates electrical signals that\nare directly passed on to the robot\u2019s hardware, instead of just changing information in a\nfile or on a screen. That also requires a power source. One option is to physically hook up to the\npower grid using wires and a socket. For example, the 2013 version of the Atlas robot developed by robotics company Boston Dynamics had a humanoid design that could walk and carry objects, much like humans do. To operate, Atlas relied on a cable that tethered\nit to a power supply. But tethering robots like this limits how\nfar they can move and interferes with the\nrobot\u2019s mobility. So to let Atlas move around more freely,\nengineers installed a battery on the robot\u2019s\nstructure so it could power itself. Unfortunately the materials of a battery tend\nto be rather heavy, which posed its own challenges. If we don\u2019t want robots like these toppling\nover all the time, it takes a bit of mechanical engineering knowhow\nto work out where to position the battery with respect\nto the robot\u2019s center of mass. You might need some chemical engineering in\nthe design of the battery, too. In the case of Atlas, engineers gave it a\nhydraulic pump in its torso to help it support\nthe extra weight of its lithium-ion battery. And now, only a few years later, it can do\nbackflips and parkour. More generally, some electrical engineering\nalso has to go into wiring the signals from the\ncomputer program to the robot\u2019s physical parts. Which brings us to another common feature\nof robots: they have mechanical parts, like grips or\nwheels, for carrying out whatever physical\ntasks they need to in their environments. That might be turning a lever, picking up\nan object, or just moving somewhere else. And there are some unique challenges to designing\nthose parts. Consider a robot designed to pick fruit from\ntrees. From an engineering perspective, it needs\nsome fundamental qualities: the ability to recognize fruits and distinguish\nthem from the rest of the plant, navigate its environment to move toward fruits\nthat need picking, and then to pick them and put them into a\ncontainer. Let\u2019s start with how it moves \u2013 a fairly\nbasic requirement for lots of robots. Like with that mining robot, you could simply put\nsome standard axles with wheels on the bottom of\nyour robot and attach them to a motor, like on a car. That would be fine if the robot was going to\nbe operating mostly on smooth, even surfaces,\nlike roads or factory floors. But most fruits are grown outdoors, sometimes\nin rough terrain and difficult environments. So you might need to design adjustable wheels\nthat change height independently, or add treads\nto overcome small bumps, like on a tank. The problem with wheels is that they\u2019re\nnot very good at overcoming large obstacles. If there\u2019s a fallen branch or a boulder\nblocking the way, the robot needs to be able\nto climb over it. Giving the robot legs could allow it to jump,\nbut that has its own problems: robots with\nlegs tend to fall down...a lot. As the team at Boston Dynamics found when\ndesigning Atlas, programming a robot\u2019s computer to interpret its\nenvironment while handling the dynamics of all\nthose mechanical parts is trickier than it seems! It really makes you appreciate what a good\njob your brain is doing. Of course, to actually make sense of its environment\nand find fruit, the robot will need sensors \u2013 devices that measure physical characteristics\nand translate them into a signal. To find apples, for example, the robot might\nhave an array of light-sensitive semiconductors, like the kind that make up the light-capturing\npixels in a digital camera, to scan an orchard. But the information sent by the camera sensor is\ninterpreted by the computer as an array of colored\npixels that don\u2019t mean an awful lot on their own. The average person, can take one glance at\na curvy shape of reddish pixels and instantly\nrecognize it as an apple. For a computer, that requires a fairly sophisticated\nvisual algorithm. What\u2019s more, people are good at seeing where the edges\n|of objects are, and interpreting the relationships they\nhave to their environment and how far away they are. You know an apple that looks very small is\nmost likely one that\u2019s far away. But even a relatively smart computer that\ncan recognize apples might not know whether it\u2019s a tiny apple only\na few centimeters away or an enormous apple\na few kilometers away. Which would affect whether the computer\u2019s\nprogramming tells it to pick the apple or not. All of these issues are what are known as\ncomputer vision problems. Computer vision deals with how to train software\nto take the input data from images or video, like the kind that are delivered from digital\ncameras, and interpret it the way a human would. Even once it\u2019s found an apple and moved\nitself close to it, the fruit picker is going to\nneed mechanical parts to actually pick fruit. The main mechanical parts used by most industrial\nrobots are called actuators and effectors. Actuators are like a robot\u2019s muscles. They convert stored energy into movement. One popular type are electrical actuators, electrical\nmotors that turn wheels or gears to rotate the robot\u2019s\nconnected parts with respect to one another. These are the sorts of mechanisms that\nwould extend the robot\u2019s arms toward or away\nfrom a particular branch. Linear actuators can achieve this by using a\nmotor to extend the part up and down a thread,\nlike a nut on a bolt. They can also use compressed fluids, like air or oil, to\nextend a part outwards, then use a motor to compress\nthe fluid and bring the parts back when needed. Effectors, meanwhile are the parts that actually\nhave an effect on the robot\u2019s environment \u2013\nbasically, the robot\u2019s hands. To deal with the irregular shapes of different fruits,\nyou could have what\u2019s called a vacuum grip that\ncan suck up large objects and hold them in place. But most of the focus on building robots has\nbeen on mechanical effectors \u2013 the kind that rely\non tactile feedback and manipulating. In other words, they give the robot an artificial\nsense of touch, perhaps with force-sensitive \nelectrodes on the effector\u2019s surface. Having a sense of feedback is important for applying the\nright amount of pressure \u2013 otherwise the apple might\nslip out of the robot\u2019s grip or be crushed into a pulp. To achieve this, the effector might be a simple\ntwo-part claw, or something more sophisticated with\nmany parts modeled on a human hand. Picking fruit is the kind of job that robots could\naccomplish at scale much more easily than humans,\nfreeing them to work on other aspects of farming. But robotics isn\u2019t just aimed at saving\nlabor. Robots can also be used in environments that\nare far too dangerous to send humans into. Bomb disposal robots \u2013 which are actually more like\ndrones \u2013 are operated by humans to find explosive\ndevices and disarm them from a safe distance. In the future, fully automated robots might\nfind uses in other harsh environments like\nthe deep sea and space. But it\u2019s likely that the place robots will have the\nmost impact won\u2019t be in the jobs they do instead\nof humans, but the ones they do alongside them. Features of robotics are already making their\nway into healthcare, like in the development\nof prosthetic limbs. But in situations like surgery or disaster\nrescue operations, a combination of human smarts and purpose-built\nrobotic strength could create safer, more efficient,\nand totally new ways of doing things. So like many engineering tools, robots will work\nbest when they weave into our existing methods,\nworking alongside us to accomplish our goals. Robots might be the future, but it\u2019s a far\ncry from the Terminator. In this episode we looked at robots and the\nengineering principles of robots. We learned how robots use sensors to interpret\ntheir environment, how actuators and effectors allow a robot to\nmanipulate the objects around it to accomplish a task, and how computers coordinate the efforts of the two.

        "Transcript": "Hi everyone, my name is Sai Vennam and I'm\nwith the IBM Cloud team. Today let's talk about Blockchain. I'm excited to talk about this because I feel\nlike there's a lot of misconceptions out there about the technology and in addition there's\na lot of concepts that can be difficult to grasp. In this video I want to dive into the fundamentals\nof Blockchain. We'll start with the definition. Blockchain is a distributed and immutable\nledger allowing me to track almost anything tangible or intangible goods. Most of us are probably familiar with crypto\ncurrencies, or Blockchain as used to track transactions. So, to better understand how Blockchains are\ndistributed let's start with an analogy. Let's say I am with a group of friends and\nI lend my friend Pat ten dollars. Now the friends see the transaction go down\nand they know that I have the correct amount of money and in addition they've essentially\nendorse the transaction and they made a record of it. Now next week when Pat comes back to me to\nask how much money had initially lent her, we could easily go to anyone of my friends\nthat have a record of that transaction. Now Blockchains are distributed as all of\nthe nodes that are running in that Blockchain network have a record of every transaction\nthat has ever taken place. Now that kind of lends itself to the distributed\nnature of Blockchain. So, all the ledger technology that has been\naround for some time, even simple ledgers, Blockchain takes advantage of it by having\na single source of truth and has a distributed nature where everyone has the same copy from\nthat Blockchain. Next let's introduce the fact the Blockchains\nare immutable. To do so let's dive into the pieces that make\nup a blockchain. So, in a block we have three major pieces. First, we're going to have the transactions. So, this is going to be all the transactions\nthat occurred when that block was created. In addition, there's going to be a hash. A hash is essentially a digital fingerprint,\nso it represents the transactions that are in the block and is completely unique. If any of the transactions were to be changed\nthe hash would also change. So, let's take a couple letters for the hash,\ngenerally it's an alphanumeric sequence and is usually a lot longer, more secure. It's also going to have the hash of the previous\nblock in the chain. So, let's say where you know right in the\nmiddle of the Blockchain here and we'll pick something for the previous hash, maybe \"2a\",\nand so now let's move on to the next block. The next block is going to have its own set\nof transactions, as well as the previous hash which corresponds to this one right here,\nas well as its own hash. And so on, and so forth we can kind of extrapolate\non all of the hashes in previous sessions. So, you can imagine that if you were to want\nto tamper with any of the transactions that occurred or change it, for example to change\none of the transactions, this one hash would change and because of that the previous hash\nof the next block in the chain would now be incorrect. So, to fix that you would have to tamper with\nevery single block in the chain and that would immediately become apparent. So, in this sense Blockchains are immutable\nand very tamper resistant. Now, the next thing I want to talk about is\nthe idea of a permissioned versus a permissionless Blockchain. So, we'll start with the permissionless Blockchain. Now, when most of us think of Blockchains\nwe're probably thinking of crypto currencies, which are public and permissionless. Now that means anyone can see all the transactions\nthat have ever taken place. Now attendees are not exactly revealed, it's\nonly the addresses that people have, but regardless all the transactions are public and in addition\nanyone can register themselves to be one of the nodes in the network essentially having\na copy of the blockchain and anytime it gets updated and new transactions are made they\nwould get a new block. So, you have to imagine it's quite a problem\nfor all of these nodes to have a copy of that Blockchain. When new transactions come in, how do they\nreach a consensus on which transactions will make up the next block? That's done so using a consensus algorithm. Let's break down how this works for a permissionless\npublic Blockchain. So, a client will first submit a transaction. That transaction will join a list of other\ntransactions that have been made on the network, and then the next thing that will happen is\nthe node is going to start picking up those transactions and validate by looking through\nall of the transactions that happen in the Blockchain so far that those are also valid. It'll kind of emulate a block and then start\nsomething called a proof of work algorithm. Now this is the consensus algorithm that public\npermissionless Blockchains use and essentially this is how they're able to reach a consensus\non which block should be next. Essentially, it's going to be a very complex\nalgorithm, cryptographic hash puzzle that all the nodes are working together to solve. As soon as one of the nodes solves it they\nhave essentially unlocked the position of the next block and what they'll do is broadcast\nthat position of the next block to all of the other nodes in the network as well as\nadding it into their own Blockchain. So, a proof of work algorithm is actually\nquite consuming on the processing and electricity on a global scale. So, although it's kind of required for supporting\npublic permissionless Blockchains where anyone can be a node and anyone can submit transactions\nor submit their hardware to kind of enable the adding of new blocks, you don't want to\ntake advantage of these kind of algorithms when you're working with Blockchain for business. This would be something like a permissioned\nBlockchain. So, in a permissioned Blockchain this would\nbe something like hyperledger fabric. You have the idea of pluggable consensus algorithms,\nnow you don't want to do something like proof of work because solving those complex algorithms\njust to find the next block is not necessary when the nodes within a blockchain network\nare trusted. So, that's one of the first concept here,\nso pluggable consensus. Now the nodes in a permissioned Blockchain\nare trusted, so they generally know each other. In addition, they don't always just represent\nusers but entire organizations. So, in this case it's actually very important\nthat our privacy is one of the main tenants of a permissioned Blockchain. Let's take an example, let's say that there's\na retailer that purchases a hundred pounds of produce at a thousand dollars. So, we'll say it's a buy order for a hundred\npounds at one thousand dollars. Now the manufacturer receives the order from\nthe retailer and says, \"OK, let's approve it. Let's make sure we have enough in the warehouse\nand let's work with the shipping company\". So, they go to the shipping company and they\nsay, \"OK, let's ship this hundred pounds\", and it's going to cost them a hundred dollars\nto actually make that shipment. Now, there's some privacy concerns here. The manufacturer has to have all the information,\nthat's fine they need to know about the buy order that was place as well as the shipment\norder that they've placed, but the retailer, although they need to know information about\nthe buy order as well as the amount, as well as the price of it, they don't necessarily\nneed to know how much it costs to ship it but they might want to know when it was shipped\nand how much it was for. On the same hand for the shipper, they need\nto know that they've placed the shipment order, the amount and the cost of it, they need to\nknow maybe when the order was placed, but they still don't necessarily need to know\nhow much the retailer spent. Now, the same goes for perhaps more retailers\nthat the manufacturer might be working with. Now if the manufacturer is offering a different\nprice for the product for one retailer rather than the other one, it doesn't make sense\nfor the retailers to know about the competing prices. So, in this case although all of the organizations\nare part of the Blockchain, only the retailers are part of the transactions that took place\nshould be able to see that information. So, in this case in Blockchain for business\nit is actually pretty important that privacy is part of the Blockchain being able to control\nwho can see particular transactional information. The last thing I want to touch on here is\nthe fact that in permissioned Blockchains you can really make transactions more efficient. I think one of the most successful applications\nof Blockchain technology is something called smart contracts. Essentially this is code that's running on\nthe Blockchain and whenever certain conditions are met, they are automatically executed. So, in this particular example, whenever that\nretailer made that purchase order to the manufacturer for this amount of goods there's probably\na manufacturing agent that double checks that the order has all the necessary information\nin it, they then probably go to the shipping agency to make sure they can cover the shipment\nand if the warehouse has the correct amount of goods. They'll then make a shipment order. Now imagine if we could automate that whole\nprocess. That's what you can do with smart contracts,\nessentially code that will make sure that all the necessary information is met, the\nwarehouse has the correct amount of goods, and then it'll automatically create the shipment\nrecord. If any one of those are conditions is not\nmet it could automatically release a refund to the buyer. This greatly speeds up the process of the\ncontract for everyone involved, the retailer, the shipper, as well as the manufacturer.

        "Transcript": "Transcriber: Sheri Friedman\nReviewer: Zsuzsa Viola What if you had a personal biomaker? Imagine a box, a biomaker. Ingredients go into the box,\nlike sunlight, biocode, and air, and biological materials go out. You can think of this like a 3D printer, but with biology. And just as 3D printing\nchanged the world of production, a personal biomaker could, too. How many of you make things? Create things? Bake things? Let\u2019s consider baking. French bakers have mastered the art\nof warm rising dough. What\u2019s so amazing is they can take\nsimple sets of ingredients, flour, salt, yeast and water, and make all kinds of different breads like the baguette. Add some milk, sugar, butter, and you can get to an entirely\ndifferent set of breads, like my favorite, a croissant. Today, I\u2019d like to tell you a story about a baker turned biomaker. And instead of mixing wet and dry\ningredients to bake breads, biomakers mix wet and dry ingredients to make medicines,\ndiagnostics and materials. If you had a biomaker, what would you make? When would you use it?\nWhere would you use it? How would it work? Could it enable anyone anywhere\nto access distributed biotechnologies for the good? Biotechnology is already all around us. Billions of RNA vaccines\nhave been administered in the fight of COVID-19. Microorganisms can be used to make\neverything from biofuels to party dresses. And plants have been taught\nto glow in the dark and may someday replace\nnightlights in our homes. Yet, despite the promise of biotechnology, it remains highly centralized and expensive. It can cost billions of dollars to build a single centralized\nbiomanufacturing plant, and these biomanufacturing plants often required cold chain,\nor refrigeration, in order to get the products\nthat they make to the people that use them. What if we could rethink\nhow we create biotechnologies and distribute them? Rather than produce a product\nin a single location and distribute it to its point of use, what if we could create\nmore local distributed biotechnologies? As a step towards distributed\nbiotechnologies and biomaking, my research laboratory is focused\non creating a new form of distributed just-add-water biotechnology that, like our French baker, can transform simple ingredients\ninto a variety of products. To understand this, we need to understand a little bit\nmore about how biology works. At the heart of biology is the ability\nto program instructions in DNA. You can kind of think \nof DNA like a cookbook. It stores the instructions,\nor recipes, for biology. What to make, when to make it, how much to make of it. What\u2019s so cool about these instructions is that they can be transcribed\nto a temporary copy that we call RNA. You can think of this\nlike your grandma\u2019s recipe card, and then this is translated\ninto protein, the meal. So information flow in biology\ngoes from DNA to RNA to protein. What do proteins do? Well, almost anything. They\u2019re the molecular doers of the cell. They give our bodies structure;\nthey help us digest our food; they even help us fight disease. For decades, scientists have harnessed\nthe ability to read, write, and edit DNA to program cells to do useful things\nlike make proteins. This has saved millions of lives through the production\nof medicines like insulin and is combating climate change\nthrough the production of meatless meats. However, engineering cells to make useful products is hampered by the tug-of-war that exists\nbetween what cells want to do, typically live and survive, and, what we want to do as engineers, have them make stuff. Put another way, yeast cells don\u2019t really care\nif they make insulin for us, and bacteria don\u2019t really care\nif they make sustainable carpets. Yet, this is the current approach. Scientists are working\nto domesticate living organisms, but engineering them\nis like trying to solve a puzzle where every time\nyou put a puzzle piece in, all of the other puzzle pieces change. My group, to address this challenge, is trying to create\na new form of biotechnology. We call this cell-free synthetic biology. What is cell-free synthetic biology? Well, we take cells. We pull off their cell walls, and we collect their insides\nfor use in biotechnology. You can kind of think of this\nlike taking a car, lifting the hood up, and pulling the engine out\nto repurpose it. Doing so allows you to reuse the engine\nfor different purposes without the constraints\nof the car chassis. For us, we\u2019re repurposing\nthe engine of the cell without the constraints\nof the intact living organism. And this opens up a whole new world\nfor biotechnology. This new world has some\npretty cool features. First, freed from the need\nto sustain life, cell-free systems offer\nan unprecedented freedom of design to create and build biological systems. Second, cell-free systems allow us\nto produce products in hours to days rather than weeks to months, as is typical for cell-based\nmanufacturing processes, because we get to separate cell growth\nfrom product production. And finally, our cell-free systems\nare inherently distributable through freeze-drying. You can kind of think of this\nlike freeze-dried fruit or astronaut ice cream. Taken together, these three features set the stage\nfor us to design anywhere and make everywhere with biotechnology. And I\u2019d like to tell you how\nwe\u2019re thinking about this in three vignettes that focus on\ndeveloping the dry ingredients of a biomaker. These examples focus on medicine,\nwater, and climate change. Let's start with medicine. Did you know that by 2050,\nit is projected that more people\u2019s lives will be threatened\nby antibiotic-resistant bacteria than are threatened today by cancer? One approach to addressing\nantibiotic-resistant bacteria is through vaccines. The idea is to teach your immune system to recognize the germs\nbefore they get inside of you. Conjugate vaccines do so\nby presenting the sugars that are typically displayed\non the outside surface of bacteria to your immune system\nso that they recognize them as foreign. And these types of vaccines\nhave been shown to be very safe and successful against numerous\ntypes of bacteria, including those that cause pneumonia. Historically, however, conjugate vaccines\nare produced using centralized facilities, and they require cold chain\nto get the vaccine to the patient. We\u2019ve created a portable\njust-add-water medicine-making platform that allows us to use freeze-dried\ncell-free ingredient to make vaccines and bypass cold chain constraints. Thinking back to our baker, the key idea is to mix\nwet and dry ingredients along with a recipe encoded in DNA that teaches these ingredients\nto make the vaccine. We\u2019ve shown that this can work\nwith several different vaccines against different bacteria, including those that cause \ndiarrhea and death in children in low- and middle-income countries. How much vaccine can we make? Well, imagine you have\na one-liter carton of milk. In that single liter in a day,\nwe can make 40,000 doses. Now, put another way, if we wanted to make enough vaccine for the 2.7 million people\nin Chicago, in just a day, it would take us 18 gallons. And right now, our manufacturing process\nhas been developed in an inexpensive way, where it costs about $0.50 a dose\nto produce these vaccines. We\u2019re pretty excited about this, and we focused on\nthe manufacturing challenge. We still need to address\nthe purification and delivery challenge, but we\u2019re excited because we think this\njust-add-water biotechnology can promote better access\nto all kinds of medicines when using decentralized production. How else might we promote\ndistributed biomanufacturing? Well, let\u2019s consider water. More than 2 billion people\nlack access to clean water. A key aspect of achieving safe\nand affordable drinking water for all is to be able to know\nwhen and where water is not safe to drink. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t often see\nor taste contaminants in water, and existing diagnostic strategies\nare typically slow and expensive. It turns out that biology\nhas developed molecular machinery that can sense many\nof the contaminants in water that we care about for safety and quality. Inspired by easy-to-use\ndiagnostic tests like pregnancy tests or COVID tests, we sought to repurpose\nthis molecular machinery in order to detect lead in water. Why lead? Well, there are many reasons. Most notably, there is no known\nsafe level of lead in water. In addition, millions of Americans\nstill get their water from lead pipes. Did you know that in Chicago alone, it\u2019s estimated that 400,000\nlead service lines still connect to the water city mains? So what we\u2019ve done\nis working with collaborators. We used our freeze-dried\ncell-free powders as before, but instead of programming them\nwith a DNA recipe to make a vaccine, we now program them with a DNA recipe\nto act as a diagnostic. This recipe encodes a genetic circuit. If you think about a thermostat\nin your house during the winter, when the room gets cold,\nan electrical circuit is connected, and that turns on the heat. Similarly, we built a genetic circuit to control the process of DNA\ngoing to protein. In the absence of a water contaminant, the circuit is off. In the presence of a water contaminant, the circuit turns on,\nand it leads to a colorimetric output that is visible by eye. After optimization, this diagnostic can detect lead\nat the legal limit in about an hour for about a quarter. We\u2019re pretty excited about this, and this system, we believe,\ncould potentially be in your hands within the next year, potentially allowing you to detect lead\nor other types of water contaminants in your own home in just minutes to hours. The third example I\u2019d like to share today\nis about climate change. Climate change is linked\nto increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Right now, most of the things\nthat we use on a day-to-day basis, from toothbrushes to shoes, have been made from carbon-based chemicals that, when produced,\nrelease carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. What if we could use biotechnologies\nto pull carbon out of the air and recycle that pollution\ninto the things that we use every day? Amazingly, nature has already created\nsome of these solutions. There are carbon-hungry microbes that have learned how to feed\noff of carbon in the air and grow. And working with collaborators,\nwe created DNA programs that allowed us to teach these microbes\nto produce sustainable chemicals like disinfectants or jet fuels. Conventional petroleum-based processing\nmakes these molecules typically emit two kilograms\nof carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for every kilogram of product\nthat's produced. In our process using biology, we actually take two kilograms\nof carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it into a kilogram of the product. We\u2019re translating these lessons\nto new-to-nature pathways in our freeze-dried cell-free powders and are excited about the potential\nfor these to spark new opportunities in planet health. So right about now, if I were in your shoes, I might be skeptical. And I get it. This all might sound too good to be true. You\u2019re taking a cell. You\u2019re ripping off its cell wall\nand collecting the insides. You add some ingredients to it,\nyou freeze-dry it, you distribute it anywhere in the world. You add a DNA program. You just add water and bam, you\u2019ve made a product\nthat benefits society. Well, I get it. I was surprised, too. But we are beginning to show\nthat this vision is possible. And there are some aspects,\nthough, that we need to still address. From a technological perspective, we\u2019ve focused on\nwhat goes into the biomaker, the freeze-dried powders\nand the DNA programs. We still need to work out\nall of the inputs and outputs. Another gap is education. We need to expand literacy and the ability\nto read and write DNA for all. Finally, creating a technology\nthat has the potential to enhance and increase\naccess to biotechnologies is inherently political\nand isn\u2019t going to change overnight. We need to develop new frameworks\nfor governance, policy and equity. I\u2019ve shown you today that we can use\nfreeze-dried cell-free powders to make medicines in a day,\ndetect lead in water in an hour, and produce sustainable chemicals\nfrom carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is all quite exciting. But if you ask me\nwhat excites me the most, it\u2019s this: It\u2019s about giving access\nto biotechnologies to everyone. No matter how much money you have, no matter what your social\neconomical status is, and no matter whether or not\nyour government can afford it. This is what a personal biomaker can do, and at scale, that is powerful. If you had a personal biomaker, what would you make and how would it change\nthe world for good? Thank you. (Applause)",

        "Transcript": "Professor Dave here, let\u2019s talk about Mendelian\ngenetics. Through a study of chemistry, biochemistry,\nand biology, we can come to know a lot about the molecular and cellular processes that\ngenerate and sustain human life. But long before we even knew that cells and\nmolecules existed, we were able to understand the concept of heredity. Children look like their parents. Traits are passed on from generation to generation,\nbe it hair color, skin tone, height, or anything else. For most of human history we had no idea how\nthis happened, and even with the biology we have just learned, it still isn\u2019t entirely\nclear. But a discussion of how traits are passed\nalong from one organism to the next is a discussion of genetics, and to do any justice to this\nfield, we must go back to its inception, with a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel grew up poor in an agricultural area\nof Europe, and entered an Augustinian monastery at age 21. After some time there, he left to study science\nin Vienna, and then returned to the monastery eager to begin his research. In Mendel\u2019s time, it was thought that heredity\nhad to do with a blending of attributes, like the way two colors mix to give an intermediate\ncolor. But this did not account for the way that\ntraits can skip a generation. Thus it seemed to Mendel that heredity must\nbe based on discrete units that can be inherited, which came to be referred to as genes. In the gene theory, each parent has a set\nof genes, and these are retained intact in the offspring. Mendel worked for several decades with pea\nplants in the garden of his monastery to produce an impressive body of data to support the\ngene theory, all of which was done decades before chromosomes were observed and understood. We will discuss the methods Mendel used to\nbreed the pea plants, and the conclusions he was able to derive from them. First of all, why peas? Well, the pea plant has a number of visible\ntraits that can vary, so results are easy to observe. These are things like flower color, seed color\nand shape, pod color and shape, flower position, and stem length. Generations of the pea plant are short and\nthe offspring are many, so data is easy to gather. And Mendel could easily control mating by\nremoving the stamens, the male fertilizing organs that produce pollen, from a particular\nset of plants. Then he could deliberately cross-fertilize\nwith pollen from other plants. This means he had complete control over which\nplants were mating with which other plants. Some plants were true-breeding with respect\nto a particular trait, meaning that some plants with purple flowers, when self-fertilizing,\ngave generation after generation of entirely purple flowering plants. The same goes for the plants with white flowers. So this meant he could breed true-breeding\nwhite flowering plants with true-breeding purple flowering plants and see what happens. This kind of process is called hybridization,\nand we can call the two true-breeding plants the parental generation, while the offspring\nwill be referred to as the F1 generation, or first filial generation, from the Latin\nword for son. If these F1 plants are allowed to reproduce\nfurther, we get the F2, or second filial generation. Mendel did experiment after experiment with\ndifferent kinds of pea plants, following the traits expressed, or phenotypes, up to the\nF2 generation. From this mountain of data, he developed two\nfundamental laws of genetics. These are the law of segregation and the law\nof independent assortment. To see how these laws were derived, let\u2019s\nexamine one of his experiments. Let\u2019s say purple flowering and white flowering\nplants are hybridized. We would find that the F1 generation is entirely\npurple. No white, no pink, just all purple. This experiment alone proves that any kind\nof blending hypothesis must be false. But even more perplexing is that if the F1\ngeneration is allowed to self-pollinate, the F2 generation gives plants that are both purple\nand white, in roughly a 3 to 1 ratio. This strongly supports what we now refer to\nas the gene theory, because it means that somewhere in the F1 plants there must have\nbeen some kind of information pertaining to white flowers that was not lost, and was expressed\nlater with the F2 plants. This white flowering gene must simply have\nbeen hidden or silenced in the F1 plants. We can therefore refer to purple flowers as\nthe dominant trait, and white flowers as the recessive trait. This combination of dominant and recessive\ntraits was observed for many other aspects of the plant, and precisely the same 3 to\n1 ratio was observed when examining the phenotypes in the F2 generation for smooth vs. wrinkled\nseeds, yellow vs. green seeds, green vs. yellow pods, and so forth. The reason for this is that each trait corresponds\nto a particular gene, like a gene for flower color. But each gene has two versions, or alleles,\nin the genome, because the gene is found on two homologous chromosomes, one from each\nparent. These two alleles can be of a different genotype,\nmeaning that the sequences of nucleotides are different, and this can lead to different\nphenotypes when expressed, like the two different colors that are visible on the flower. Although Mendel didn\u2019t know anything about\nDNA, he still was able to decipher this concept of two alleles per trait. True-breeding plants must have identical alleles\nfor a particular trait, but when he performed the hybridization, he realized that one allele\nwas dominant, in that it was expressed, while the other was recessive, and stayed dormant. In this case, when purple and white are hybridized,\nthe F1 generation is all purple, so purple must be dominant. He even realized that each gamete must have\nonly one of these alleles such that when each plant is fertilized, one of any of the possible\ncombinations of alleles will result. This is the law of segregation. We now understand this is true because we\nhave learned about meiosis and the haploid daughter cells that result. In this way, Mendel was able to explain the\nphenotypes in the F2 generation by rationalizing that true-breeding purples have two purple\nalleles, and true-breeding whites have two white alleles, so when the sperm from one\nfertilizes the egg from the other, all of the resulting plants in the F1 generation\nmust have one of each allele. Because purple is dominant, they are all purple. But when the F1 generation produces its own\ngametes, some will be purple and some will be white, so when they self-fertilize, there\nare four possible combinations, and those are purple and purple, purple and white, white\nand purple, or white and white. Since purple is present in three of those,\nthat explains the three to one ratio, given that only a plant with two recessive white\nalleles will appear white. This kind of logic can be displayed using\nPunnett squares. For these, we make a grid, and along the top\nboxes we place the alleles for one plant. If we are allowing the F1 generation to reproduce,\nall of those have one purple allele, which we can symbolize with a capital P, since we\ncapitalize the dominant allele, and the white allele will be a lower case p, as it is recessive. The other plant will have its alleles to the\nleft of the boxes. Then, we just populate the boxes to form all\nthe possible pairing combinations. Dominant alleles are listed first, and there\nis the distribution just as we described before, with a three to one ratio of purple to white\nin the F2 generation. When an organism has identical alleles for\na particular gene it is said to be homozygous for that gene. If it has one of each allele, we call it heterozygous. As we can see, homozygous dominant and heterozygous\nboth result in the dominant phenotype. Only homozygous recessive results in the recessive\nphenotype being visible in the plant. For this reason, we must understand that observing\nthe phenotype that is visible for a particular trait in an organism does not tell us with\ncertainty what genotype is present, as multiple genotypes result in the same phenotype. However, we can breed this organism with another\norganism that has a known genotype for that trait and analyze the phenotypic distribution\nin the resulting generation to decipher what the unknown genotype must be. When Mendel discovered the law of segregation,\nhe was looking at one trait at a time, which we would call a monohybrid cross. But when he started looking at two traits\nat the same time, he discovered the law of independent assortment. He knew that the seeds of the pea plant could\nbe either yellow or green, with yellow being dominant, and they could be either or round\nor wrinkled, with round being dominant. He took true-breeding plants with round yellow\nseeds and crossed them with true-breeding plants with wrinkled green seeds, performing\na dihybrid cross. As we would expect, all the plants in the\nF1 generation end up heterozygous for both traits, thus exhibiting the dominant phenotype\nfor both traits. But because we are examining two traits at\nonce, there are now four possible combinations of alleles produced in the gametes of the\nF1 plants. If these plants reproduce, we end up with\na variety of possible genotypes for the F2 plants, because the Punnett square must involve\nall possible combinations of all possible gametes from two different plants. The phenotypic distribution for a dihybrid\ncross will always be 9 to 3 to 3 to 1, where the 9 represents the proportion of the F2\ngeneration that will exhibit the dominant phenotype for both traits, 3 represents the\nproportion that will show dominant for one and recessive for the other, the other 3 is\nfor the reverse situation, and the 1 is for the ones that will be recessive for both. These results are significant, because they\nshow that each trait is determined individually. Just because the F1 generation was heterozygous,\nit doesn\u2019t mean that the F2 will be. The alleles for each trait separate at random\nduring gamete formation, thus demonstrating the law of independent assortment, and also\ndemonstrating that the combination of alleles that occur in any given organism is determined\nentirely by probability. Sixteen possible combinations, one in sixteen\nchance for each one, so roughly one in every sixteen plants will exhibit a particular genotype. Because of this mathematical reliability,\nwe can use the rules of probability to predict phenotypic distributions for more complicated\ncombinations. Not all patterns of inheritance are this simple,\nunfortunately, and as impressive as Mendel\u2019s experiments were, he could not explain certain\nobservations. But since his time we have extended Mendelian\ngenetics to explain these observations as well, as we now understand that certain alleles\nare not completely dominant or recessive, some genes have more than two alleles, and\na single gene can sometimes produce multiple phenotypes. For example, there are degrees of dominance. With everything so far, we have been discussing\ncomplete dominance, where the dominant allele is expressed whether the genotype is homozygous\nor heterozygous, and there is no difference in the resulting phenotype. But there is also incomplete dominance. When red snapdragons are crossed with white\nones, the F1 generation is all pink. This is a third, intermediate phenotype. But this does not mean that the red and white\nalleles are gone. If we look at the F2 generation, we get a\n1 to 2 to 1 ratio of red to pink to white. The alleles maintain their identities. Codominance is also possible, where two different\nphenotypes are both expressed simultaneously. But this more advanced understanding of genetics\nrequired knowledge about chromosomes that Mendel never had, so let\u2019s learn about chromosomes.",

        "Transcript": "our planet has been draped in ice sheets filled with boiling hot oceans and dimmed by volcanic ash all before anything more complicated than a single-celled organism showed up so climate change is nothing new around here when it happens gradually over millions of years but something new has happened in the last few centuries People Like Us except wearing hats like this began burning fossil fuels like coal oil and natural gas to make energy most of us aren't wearing hats like those anymore but we're still powering our daily lives and industries with those fuels releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide every year and that's caused earth's climate to change in the span of just a few human lifetimes the geological blink of an eye hi I'm Dr Sammy your friendly neighborhood entomologist and this is Crash Course biology hey do you guys smell that smells like same music [Music] now I know what you're thinking wait is isn't this crash course biology and yeah this episode is heavy on the gases low on the Golgi bodies and that might leave you wondering what does climate change have to do with the signs of Life here's the thing life and climate are tied together like that Tangled pair of headphones at the bottom of your backpack you know like you you tug one end and then a knot tightens which is looked around a paper clip somehow snagged on that tiny notebook where he drew Hearts around your crush's name which after several drugs is now lying open on the floor and I'm breaking a new cool switch thinking about it um but back to the point we can't talk about life without talking about climate which doesn't mean last week's thunderstorm or or a one-day temperature swing that's weather climate is long-term weather conditions averaged over many years to understand the difference between them just remember that knowing the weather will help you decide if you should grab an umbrella before you head out but knowing the climate will help you decide if you should invest in a good air conditioner while the weather might impact your choice of clothing for the day the climate directly impacts wear and when different kinds of Life can survive we owe today's climate to the fact that our little green and blue marble of a home isn't just floating in space unprotected it's wrapped up in an atmosphere a big invisible gassy jacket which granted sounds pretty weird when you put it that way but without it we wouldn't exist this jacket is made of different kinds of gases and a small fraction of them known as greenhouse gases absorb solar energy like super well we're talking about gases like methane water vapor and most importantly carbon dioxide also known as CO2 they account for less than half of one percent of our atmospheric jacket but they're a part of what makes it so good at trapping heat sort of like all the little white feathers in your puffy coat when sunlight beams down from space most of it travels through those gases with no problem the energy from that sunlight gets absorbed as it strikes the Earth warming the surface that type of warming is normal and seasonal the Earth naturally bounces some of that solar energy back towards space where some of it exits the atmosphere and heads right back out into the inky ether but the rest of that energy gets trapped by the Earth's gassy jacket specifically by those super absorbent greenhouse gases which suck up heat and bounce it back down to us again this warming process is called the greenhouse effect unsurprisingly it works the same way as a greenhouse using layers of glass to trap heat inside and it keeps Earth at a nice cozy insulated average of 14 degrees Celsius without it our Earth would be a chilly average temperature of negative 18 degrees Celsius great for storing ice cream the rainforests swimsuits or us for that matter so the greenhouse effect is a natural healthful process that makes Earth habitable for all of life but you can have too much of a good thing when our atmospheric jacket contains more carbon dioxide for example it gets really good at trapping heat like too good and the hotter things get the more water evaporates and joins the atmosphere and remember water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas so that in turn absorbs even more heat creating a looping system of cause and effect that just keeps reinforcing itself and while dressing in layers is great if you're hiking in the Alps it's really hard for our planet to shed its extra coats so all of that heat gets stuck going from the ground to the atmosphere like the worst game of hot potato ever played when I learned about this I was like wow what a revelation I can't believe we've only recently figured this out but it turns out that this isn't new knowledge we've known how and why this could happen for nearly 170 years let's pay a visit to the theater of life back in 1856 Eunice foot an American scientist and suffragette was thinking about how the sun's warmth affected different gases in those days the scientific Community was a bit like a fort with a handmade no girls allowed sign out front but foot wasn't deterred and ran her experiments anyway she filled tubes with different combinations of gases including carbon dioxide after putting some tubes in the Sun and some in the shade she compared their temperatures trying to find the hottest gas all the tubes in direct sunlight warmed up but none as intensely as the tube that contained carbon dioxide the temperature had soared to 51.7 degrees Celsius hot enough to burn your fingers from that Insight foot theorized that if our atmosphere ever contained more carbon dioxide the whole planet would warm up as a result which would mean a lot more than a few slided fingers and sure enough today that's exactly the situation we're in foot was one of the first scientists to recognize carbon dioxide's potential to affect earth's climate but she wasn't the only one to connect the dots for example just a few decades later another scientist named Dr cevante arenius observes that burning coal releases carbon dioxide as a fossil fuel coal forms from the decomposed carbon-based bodies of plants and animals that lived and died a long time ago and I'm talking before the dinosaurs so no I'm afraid that means you aren't gassing up your car with the remains of a T-Rex when we burn those fossil fuels whether it's in the form of coal oil or natural gas carbon dioxide gets released into the atmosphere when Arenas ran the numbers he predicted that carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels could warm our climate within a few thousand years if we kept burning them at their current rate but we far outpaced his estimates our emissions of carbon dioxide have grown and grown and grown and so has the mountain of evidence that those emissions are warming our planet some oil and gas companies have worked to promote uncertainty around the existence of climate change and what's causing it while they have only very recently acknowledged its existence as of 2023 they're still trying to deflect from what's causing it but the scientific consensus on this is overwhelming you can learn much more about that in our climate and energy series we've only been reliably taking direct measurements of Earth's Global temperature since the 19th century but at measly slice of Time Shows a steady rise in temperature of a about 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1880 and we know that that's unusual because we've learned to read Earth's much longer climate diary in the form of ice cores see when snow hardens into ice Tiny Bubbles of air remain trapped in the gaps between snowflakes these gases and water molecules stay frozen like entries in a frosty Journal so by drilling deep down into Polar Ice we can snoop on what the atmosphere was like hundreds of thousands of years ago ice cores show us that carbon dioxide levels have fluctuated over the past 800 000 years and and temperatures have fallen and risen alongside them too but when people started burning fossil fuels carbon dioxide levels began to spike quickly like really really quickly and they haven't stopped Rising before the Industrial Revolution for every million molecules of air in our atmosphere around 280 were carbon dioxide molecules but by 2022 the number had increased to 422 the highest concentration of carbon dioxide our planet is seen in 4 million years and that's surge in carbon dioxide affects more than just the temperature as the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere Rises it impacts all of Earth's systems like yanking on the end of that Tangled mess of headphones impacted all of the other items in my bag and eventually everybody around us when stuff started falling out it's all connected is what I'm saying for example the ocean is our planet's largest carbon sink it's sort of like a big storage container for carbon in fact the ocean holds 50 times more carbon than the air or soil do but a chemical reaction happens when carbon dioxide meets water it creates an acid so that influx of carbon has already turned the ocean 30 percent more acidic since the 19th century as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases trap more heat there's more energy pouring into our planet than going out that means more energy is pumped into the ocean fueling hurricanes and and typhoons to become more frequent and more intense as the whole planet gets hotter that triggers all kinds of changes spring arrives earlier leading to Shorter Winters and longer summers Rising temperatures lead to double whammy droughts and heat waves and that leaves Forest floors full of dried up plants that serve as fuel for wildfires to ignite spreading faster farther and more often plus Earth's polar ice caps are melting transforming solid ice to slush and sea water and that's causing ocean levels to rise and encroach on land so while some communities are already facing a problem of not enough water others are facing a problem of too much and because these adverse changes layer on top of existing social inequalities they disproportionately affect lower income communities and people of color making climate change not only a scientific issue but a matter of environmental justice that has spurred some researchers to political action for example climate scientist Nicole Hernandez Hammer witnessed firsthand through her field research the sea level rise alongside Miami Beach's Latino communities but these communities were not included in conversations about climate change or the dangers of rising sea levels so hammer took action moving into environmental Outreach and education and while the threat is still there these communities are now in conversation about climate change and able to plan and advocate for the future of their environment and the good news more broadly is we know exactly why these Tangled complex effects are happening the more we burn those fossil fuels the more greenhouse gases we release and that's driving sweeping changes all over our planet and these changes are impacting life at all levels from the tiniest bacterium to the elephants of Botswana to you and me we can slow these impacts by breaking up with fossil fuels but we also have to invest in Nature's carbon sinks such as soils and forests Which pull carbon out of the atmosphere and back into the land where it can't keep heating things up it won't be the easiest breakup we've designed whole societies and Global Systems around fossil fuels we should fully expect to be listening to Jasmine Sullivan on repeat with a gallon of rocky road but this is one relationship we can't afford to stay in so in order to hold emissions we have to both invent new systems and work more efficiently within old ones and to do that we've got to get a whole planet's worth of people on board and if you've ever been part of a group project you know that last part isn't easy thankfully when faced with global crises humans have one great thing going for us we are creative I mean we've been to space we've we've got electric cars we made Furbies for some reason and so yes it's going to take all of our creativity and cooperation to tackle but the only way through in the only way through is together in our next episode we'll tune back into the world of living things and see how our rapidly changing climate involves much more than the atmosphere it affects every living breathing organism on this planet including you and me this series was produced in collaboration with hhmi biointeractive if you're an

        "Transcript": "More than 50% of the world\u2019s\npopulation live in urban areas. By 2050, it could be\nnearly seventy percent. Big cities have big needs when it\ncomes to water, food, and energy. This heavy demand on resources\nposes daunting challenges to researchers in a world\ngrappling with climate change. Those cities and towns will\nneed large amounts of energy. Revolutionizing the complex\nsystems of our energy supply is one of the biggest challenges for\na global transition to green energy. And for people, probably\nthe most tangible. So, for us, as cities, and responsible\nfor the policy in the cities, I think it\u2019s so important\nthat we take a leading role. Because it is possible\nfor cities to change. So we are very conscious that\nwe need to move into an economy that is renewable and\ncircular and nature positive, all those at\nthe same time. Actually, we don\u2019t\nhave a choice. I think that we have little\ntime left to save the planet. So, we have to do whatever\nwe can as fast as possible. To see how a sustainable\nenergy supply can work in practice, we head to the\nUnited States. There, a California\ncity is aiming to become the first carbon-neutral\ncommunity in the country. Lancaster is home to\nabout 175,000 residents. In 2009, officials started\non a journey to go green fundamentally transforming the\ncity\u2019s economy and infrastructure. Not only was it a\ntechnological overhaul more importantly, it\nwas a shift in mentality. It\u2019s the purpose of government to\nassist people, not to delay people. It used to take a\nminimum of six months if this person wanted to\nput solar panels on their roof. They have to\nget a permit. Somebody would always\nhave a design change, but it would take six months\njust for them to be allowed to do it. And so when I found that\nout, I sent out a memo. It now takes 45 minutes,\nand it better be 45 minutes. In the city of Lancaster,\nthe hardest part was changing the\nculture within the city staff that we look for reasons to say yes,\nwe don\u2019t look for reasons to say no. You know, when we\nstarted out down this path, we were laughed at, we were\nscorned, we were, you know, Facebook lit up every day, but we set out to develop\na model for a city that, once the world woke up, it\nwould be easier for them to do it. As we went\ndown this path, we made more money than\nyou can possibly imagine. Alternative energy is profitable\nand it\u2019s profitable in a huge way. Lancaster\u2019s mayor, Rex Parris, began by having\nphotovoltaic panels installed on all municipal\nbuildings. The generated electricity\nwas used for public lighting. In the process, Parris discovered\nit saved the city a lot of money. The saved dollars were put\ntowards installing even more photovoltaic panels on the\nroofs of private residences. These systems also became\nmandatory for new buildings. Bit by bit, Lancaster created\nan alternative energy network. Excess electricity started\nbeing used to generate hydrogen to fuel public\ntransportation. The low-cost electricity and cheap\nhydrogen attracted new, large companies. And Lancaster solidified its\nreputation as a green boomtown in the United\nStates. I traveled a lot. I went to the World Economic Forum\nin Tianjin, I went to Saudi Arabia, I went to the Middle East every energy\nconference, and I learned a lot. Thanks to the\nsunny weather and the already existing solar\nand wind parks in the area, green energy and hydrogen\nproduction continued to expand. When Lancaster began the process\nof transforming its own energy system in 2009, the unemployment\nrate was at 17%. In 2023, it dropped\nto around 6%. Lancaster became a self-sufficient\ngreen energy powerhouse and highly\nprofitable too. Once people start being\ninnovative and creative, it doesn\u2019t stop with the\nimmediate goal in front of you. It extends\neverywhere. This really is the most exciting city\nin the world, I think, for that reason. We have a common purpose,\nand it\u2019s a simple purpose. It\u2019s that our\nchildren survive. You know, that\u2019s\nnot hard, you know. And when you have that\nas a common purpose, you can put aside all the differences\nand you can make things happen. You can build things that\nhave never been built before. You know, this project here,\nis actually quite remarkable. In recent years, both the city\nof Lancaster and Mayor Parris have been recognized with\nmany awards for the achievement. From the US state of\nCalifornia to Wunsiedel, in the German\nstate of Bavaria a rural region where\nthe forest industry is key. When Marco Krasser took the\nhelm of the regional energy supplier, everything\nhere changed. What would an\nenergy supply look like if we only could use renewable\nenergies and sustainable raw materials? Well, we harness sunlight\nand wind energy and store them. Wunsiedel shifted\nto a circular system that effectively linked its\nregionally strong timber industry with the local\nenergy system. The idea was to re-use as much\nenergy as possible, multiple times. And wherever excess\nenergy accumulated say, in the form of wood waste\nor waste-heat from machines it shouldn\u2019t be lost\nbut rather harnessed. We have wood, we have\nbiomass, we have sun and wind. We may not have hydropower, but we\nuse everything locally that we need. Surplus energy generated\nfrom solar and wind power is used to press forestry\nwaste into wood pellets. The pellets can then be\nburned to generate heat, or to power a\nturbine for electricity. It forms a cascaded system which\nalways consists of the same thing: solar and wind, battery storage,\nand combined heat and power. It\u2019s the perfect system which\ncouples both sectors and industries. The construction industry is\nlinked to the timber industry; the timber industry is linked\nwith agriculture or forestry. This creates local circular energy\neconomies that can be scaled up to all levels, which in turn\nsatisfy the energy demand in the form of\nelectricity and heat. And electricity in\nterms of mobility. Wunsiedel in Bavaria\nand Lancaster in California: Both have tapped into their locally\navailable resources as best they can. And both have created\ninfrastructures in which green energy can be used as efficiently as\npossible in an ongoing cycle. Of course, such systems\nare ideally integrated into construction projects\nfrom the very start. In Copenhagen, a newly-built\ndistrict called Nordhavn served as the testing ground\nfor the \u201cEnergyLab\u201d project a living laboratory for\nresearch into innovative and more efficient\nenergy cycles. Well, the essence is that we\ntest the solutions in real life. In EnergyLab Nordhavn, we have\nalso been looking into business models because that\u2019s also\npart of the solution. Innovation and business\nmodels is part of the solution. In this sector coupling context,\nit\u2019s very important that we utilize the energy that is available\nand this is basically something that we are demonstrating\nhere in the Nordhavn project. We can say that the energy\nsystem has to develop, we have to do it in\na more smart way, and that means that we need to\nsee what other sources are available and how can we in the best\npossible way actually utilize them. The buildings here are\nwell-insulated and retain heat. That\u2019s a money-saver \u2014 and is\nespecially important at peak hours in the early\nmornings. Plus, commercial businesses\nin the neighborhood can compress\ntheir waste-heat and supply it to the\ndistrict heating system, which provides heat to\nthe surrounding buildings. The compressors for\ncooling down the goods, they are run by electricity and\nby using a little bit more electricity in the compressors, we\nget way more heat available. So in situations where we have\nsurplus electricity from wind turbines or photovoltaic, we can\nactually optimize operation of the compressors and\nconvert that into a lot extra energy that can be used\nin the buildings. And in that way, is this system\nactually a smart component in the sector coupled\nenergy system. Here again, an ingenious cycle. The energy put into the system is not single-purpose \u2014\nrather, it\u2019s used several times. And the whole\nneighborhood benefits. The goal of a modern circular\neconomy is to save energy and increase\nefficiency. These cycles are optimized to\nmake energy competitive in price while serving as an extension\nor even an alternative to the large, centralized grids. Norway and its capital\nOslo are among the pioneers in the green\nenergy transition. Oslo is aiming to reduce\nCO2 emissions to zero by 2030. Mayor Marianne Borgen helped to draft and pass a\nseries of concrete measures. We have all the way\ntried to tell our inhabitants that this is not\nabout restrictions. So it\u2019s not about\nrestrictions. It's about\nopportunities. When we are building new\nkindergartens and schools, they are built with\nsolar cell panels. And they also produce more energy\nthan they need to use themselves. So we can put it over\nto other buildings nearby. Oslo is considered the\nworld capital of e-mobility. It\u2019s also made\nsignificant headway in making its construction sector\ncarbon-neutral with advancements in heating and\nbuilding materials. We have said in Oslo that we want\nto be the first zero emission city in the world by 2030, which is a very\nambitious goal, but it is possible. I think that is so important both\nto try to reduce the consumption, of course, but also reduce the waste\nand also to reuse and also recycle. I think that these are all important\nelements in the total policy. To achieve this\nambitious goal, both residents and businesses\nmust play an active part. Hege Sch\u00f8yen Dillner spent\nseveral years of her career working at a large Scandinavian\nconstruction company based in Oslo. The company has more\nthan 8,000 employees and carries out\nprojects worldwide. As a board member, she pushed\nthe company to publicly commit to implementing the goals of the 2015\nParis Agreement on climate change. She also supported\nMayor Borgen's measures. I think the biggest\nmoment in my career was when the whole\nmanagement team decided that we would work\ntowards the Paris Agreement. We didn\u2019t know exactly how we should\ndo it, but we set a clear direction. And I think that was so\ncrucial, to set the direction. And then some people said:\nBut what if we can\u2019t make it? And I said: Well, I\u2019m\nnot so afraid about that. I'm afraid that we don't\ndare to set the direction. With all her experience, Hege\nSch\u00f8yen Dillner sat for years on the board of the Norwegian\nGreen Building Council, which is part of the World\nGreen Building Council. I think it will be very important how\nwe build our cities the next 30 years. In 2022, we reached eight\nbillion people on Earth, and by 2050 there\nwill be 10 billions. That means a city the size of Vienna\nwill be built every week until 2050. That's a lot of aluminum and steel\nand glass and wood and concrete and plastic\nand bricks. So we have\nto go circular. We have to build\nwith less for longer. Sonja Horn manages a real\nestate company in Norway. When constructing\nnew buildings, the company aims to reuse as many\nelements as possible from old office buildings that are\nbeing torn down. When building a modern office complex\nin Oslo, the company fused old with new. It was a pilot project, meaning\nsuccess was not guaranteed. But almost immediately, startups\nand tenants started moving in precisely because they\nwere drawn to the concept. Hege Sch\u00f8yen Dillner also\nhad an office there for some time. It\u2019s a reused\nreflector panel. Also the fence here used to be\non the floor in the swimming pool in the technical room and\nis being used all the way up as a railing\nin the atrium. So those are some of the\nmore interior aspects of re-use, we also refer to\nit as upcycling. So it goes from one thing to\nbe upcycled to something else. We\u2019ve been working\nsystematically on finding out how we can make\nbuildings part of the solution. I mean, buildings account for around\n40% of carbon emissions globally, 40% of energy use, so a\nhuge part of the problem. Meaning that we also\nhave the opportunity to be a huge part\nof the solution. In 2019, an\noffice building commissioned by Sonja\nHorn's company was inaugurated in the Norwegian\ncity of Trondheim. It was named:\n\"Powerhouse.\" The roof is covered\nwith solar panels, angled optimally to capture\nthe sun\u2019s rays in northern Europe. As a result, the Powerhouse, with\nits 3,000 square meters of panels, produces an annual average of\n500,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. That is more than double\nthe amount it consumes itself. The surplus electricity is\nused on a local micro-grid to supply neighboring buildings,\nand electric buses and cars. And this is a pioneer project, it\u2019s\none of a kind, the first of its kind. So it\u2019s attractive for young\npeople to sit and work here. And it feels good. Whenever we build new, we have\nfocused on mainly three aspects: One is to use less\nresources and materials, so whatever you\ncan reuse is excellent. If you can\u2019t reuse, maybe\nyou can use recycled materials before you start\nsourcing new materials. More and more of the construction\nsites that we have in Oslo are now zero emission\nconstruction site because the\ntechnology is in place. We need to challenge\nthe establishments, the industry and also show the way. The employers and employees in business\nare now largely as a general trend, very much on board,\nthat cutting emissions is not only the right thing\nto do for the world's climate and the future of our kids but is\nactually also smart in the economy. Like Oslo, the rest of Norway is\naiming to be carbon neutral by 2030. The country has a\nlarge oil and gas sector, but it also has a\nwealth of hydropower. Norwegian Minister Espen\nBarth Eide is confident that the necessary transition\nto a carbon-neutral economy comes with more opportunities\nthan risks for domestic industries. We\u2019re also seeing that the\nservice industry that was developed because of the 50\nyears of petroleum is now very eager to themselves\ngo into these new areas. Because if you can run oil or\ngas platforms in the North Sea in 10-meter high waves\nand extreme conditions, you can also\ndo floating wind. If you\u2019re good at building fossil\nships with advanced technology, you\u2019re also good at building\nhydrogen or ammonia driven ships with advanced\ntechnology. This circular energy economy relies\nas much on technological innovation from major industries\nas it does on a stable grid that can provide constant\nand reliable green power. In northern Europe, that can\nbest be achieved with wind power from offshore parks\nand with hydropower. If the countries\nbordering the North Sea can help balance one another\u2019s\ndemand for green power, it could result in\nan international grid, which could become\na model worldwide. The longest of these subsea links\nto date was constructed in 2021 to connect Norway with\nEngland's eastern coast. At some hydroelectric\npower stations in Norway, water drops hundreds of\nmeters to propel turbines that generate\ngigawatts of electricity. At Kvilldal, hydropower is\nconverted for onward transmission and transmitted\nto Blyth in England, where gigawatts of electricity\nare generated from offshore wind. What we\u2019re installing\nin here at the moment which is a\nconverter station that physically does the\nconversion of the current, so it converts direct current down\nto alternating current or vice versa. Ultimately, we have interconnectors\nto allow where we can take in, you know, green energy from\nlakes of Norway, hydro energy, into the\ncountry itself, so it\u2019s enabling that transition of\ngreen energy not just for the UK but our neighboring countries,\nwhether that\u2019s Norway, whether that\u2019s France, whether\nthat\u2019s Denmark or is somewhere else. Britain has become a leader in Europe\nin developing offshore wind power in the North Sea. It\u2019s now become an\nexporter of green power. It\u2019s a super-fast\ngreen highway that allows the transfer of energy from\neither country we\u2019re connecting to. It also brings\nsecurity of supply. Once a prosperous\nmining town, Blyth suffered a sharp economic\nblow from the decline of coal mining. Port of Blyth Manager Martin\nLawlor hopes the power link will help return the\ntown to its former glory. So the Port of Blyth is already\na major offshore energy hub for the UK and that\u2019s actually helping\nto attract further investments, so companies want to\nbe part of this cluster, they want to feed off some of the\nspecialty hydraulics and electrics, some of the vessel operators,\nand those building cable factories, and that will help to drive further\ninvestments all around the estuary. Are the first signs of an\neconomic upswing due to the energy transition\non the horizon? We are seeing this growth\naccelerating around the Blyth estuary. So the Port of Blyth is very\nmuch part of the town of Blyth. And the community is very much with\nthe port in what we\u2019re doing here. They see the jobs coming in,\nthey see the benefits to the economy and looking\nto the future, we\u2019re going to hope that the majority\nof those jobs will go to local people, so they are very\nmuch with us. The world's largest network\nto reliably generate energy has been under construction\nin the North Sea since 2020. In order for a new energy\neconomy to succeed, it\u2019s crucial to build large green\npower grids that are stable. By becoming partners\nin a new North Sea grid through direct\ncoast-to-coast lines, border countries are inching closer to\nthe goal of attaining energy security. Europe has to be able\nto collaborate even better. I think every European state leader\nand the European Union leaders, it has dawned to them\nthat we need to collaborate much stronger than we ever\nthought we were that was possible. This North Sea grid will\ndeploy the latest technology to exchange generated energy\nback and forth on demand. Large industrial centers\nwill be built at the hubs, like this planned \u201cenergy\nisland\u201d off the coast of Jutland. More should follow\nand be interconnected. In the future, they could form a kind\nof inner network on the high seas. Essentially, it\u2019s an artificial island\nthat can be expanded over time. But what is really great\nabout an energy island is that it can actually\npower different countries around the North\nSea at the same time. The first of these energy islands\nis to be built about 80 kilometers off the coast of Jutland and,\naccording to the latest estimates, cost more than\n30 billion euros. It is the first of several hubs\nfor the new energy sector. The island alone should\none day provide electricity for up to 10\nmillion households. This will require large substations\nwhere alternating current can be converted to direct\ncurrent and back again. That\u2019s vital to transmit\nelectricity over long distances. It started very much as a\ntechnology that would help integrating large bulk power and\ntransmitting long distances with a much better efficiency\nbecause of much lower losses. The more systems\nwe integrate, the more complex the entire\nenergy system becomes. If I need to\nintegrate the next 20, 30% of electrical vehicles\ninto the electricity system, if I need to integrate 40, 50, 60\ngigawatt worth of offshore wind, there is a need to anticipate\nthe planning and the investments in order to deploy the\ngrid technology on time. Sixty gigawatts is\nroughly equivalent to the capacity of forty\nnuclear power plants. On the eastern\ncoast of Britain, construction on a new power\ncable was recently completed. It connects the grids of Britain\nand Denmark and will supply them with electricity from both\ncountries\u2019 offshore wind parks. The new interconnector between the two\ncountries is called the Viking Link. With a length of\n765 kilometers, it\u2019s the longest subsea\npower cable in the world. To meet an ever-growing\nneed for energy in the future, large storage facilities\nwill be required in addition to transmission\ninfrastructure. Hydrogen has immense potential as a\nstorage medium for green electricity. At a Siemens\nEnergy site in Berlin, a simulator shows the total demand for energy in a complex\nindustrial society. Hydrogen could become\nthe new optimal energy carrier. Which means the technology\nto produce hydrogen already holds great\nstrategic significance, even if the industrial infrastructure\nis only just being built now. One way to make\nHydrogen is via electrolysis, a process which uses an\nelectric current to split water into hydrogen\nand oxygen. The electricity to\ncarry out this process must come from renewable sources\nso that its production is sustainable. The advantage of electrolyzers\nis that they can be integrated into existing economic\ncycles relatively easily. Anne-Laure de Chammard is a member of\nthe Executive Board of Siemens Energy. The whole idea is to\nhave a modular system where you can actually\nadd them to each other, so it\u2019s the same building\nblock but you can add them to each other to be able\nto reach the right scale, the gigawatt scale that\nis needed and really stick and be very able to adjust to\nthe demand of our customers, depending on if it\u2019s\na small industrial site or a very large utility\nscale hydrogen production. In the future, an industrial\nsite could use electrolysis to secure its electricity\nsupply with hydrogen storage. How much is needed\nduring daily peak hours? How much hydrogen\nwould it take to replace a conventional power\nplant for example? These estimates can be used to determine the best\nenergy alternatives. Hydrogen is available in\nvirtually unlimited quantities and could become\nthe key to future supply. I would say there\u2019s maybe three\nlevers for the energy transition: the energy\nefficiency part, which is reducing the energy\nconsumption by really going there and finding everywhere\nwhere we can have recycling of the energy\nthat is produced. Then, electrification,\neverywhere where it is possible because this is going to be the\ncheapest way to decarbonize. And then, hydrogen and green\nmolecules where this electrification would not be enough and\nwhere we need to capture that to be able to store it and\nreuse it elsewhere or in processes. But hydrogen can\ndo more than that. It can be further refined\nwith CO2 into new fuels. Until now, these fuels have been\nsupplied primarily by fossil fuels in heavy industry. The hope is that\nhydrogen can be the basis for a whole range\nof fuels in the future. Hydrogen per se will\nbe used as hydrogen, but a lot will also be transformed\ninto what we call e-fuels so where we capture carbon,\nthat we mix with this hydrogen, to then be able to do\nin a synthetic manner any of the fuels\nthat you know today. Professor\nBernd Rech is the Scientific Director at\nthe Helmholtz Centre in Berlin. He oversees projects that use\nBESSY, a particle accelerator. BESSY is used to\nconduct targeted research into energy conversion\nand storage mediums. That includes making\nsolar cells more efficient and refining hydrogen\ninto new fuels. Since when have I been convinced\nthat something about our energy supply and energy system\nneeded to change? It was simply the idea\nthat the physical potential of renewable energy is great enough\nto supply our planet and humanity and that it\u2019s relatively\neasy to achieve. That\u2019s what\u2019s\nconvinced me and has gripped\nme ever since. So to translate that into modern\nmaterials and technologies, we can convert the energy of\nthe sunlight into electrical energy. And that energy we can\nconvert into green electricity. And then we\ncan, for example, use electrolysis to split water\ninto hydrogen and oxygen. And through\nthis process, we have chemical energy\ncarriers that we can use. And if we think big picture,\nwe could be in the position to, for example, bind hydrogen\nto CO2 from the atmosphere and then generate\nsynthetic fuels. Sonya Calnan leads a research\nproject at the Helmholtz Centre. The goal is to use solar\nenergy and hydrogen to produce cleaner\ncooking fuels. These could\nbe sold in places where there\u2019s no electricity\navailable for cooking which is the case in many\nareas around the world. The project is a collaboration\nbetween the team in Berlin and the University of\nCape Town in South Africa. I always start from the\nphotovoltaic cells because right now, since when I started, right now\nthey\u2019ve become something common place, so I tell them: Do you see\nthose solar cells on their roof? You can use them not\nonly to make electricity but also to make hydrogen and\nother things, even to clean water, if you connect them to the\nright type of chemical reactor and they provide the power and\nthen you can almost do anything without needing a diesel\ngenerator for example. In many poorer\nparts of the world, wood and fossil\nfuel products such as propane are used\nfor both cooking and heating. Converting hydrogen\nand CO2 into a clean fuel would be a\nsustainable alternative. When you go to buy your\ncooking gas, you go once, once maybe every month,\ninstead of collecting firewood is quite bulky so if you collect\nsome firewood for one day, it\u2019s not enough, then you\nhave to go the next day and so time spent going\nto collect the firewood all the time is kind of saved and\nthis time can be used for other, more developmental\nactivities. Projects like these are still\nin the experimental stage. But the hope is that they\u2019ll\nbecome building blocks in an ever-expanding\ncircular energy economy. All around the world,\nmore and more research is being conducted\ninto green technologies. Singapore especially is considered\na laboratory for the future. Professor Madhavi\nSrinivasan is tackling one of the main problems\nof the new energy economy. Along with hydrogen, batteries are\nthe most important storage medium. But they\u2019re made of costly\nmaterials which are becoming more and more scarce as\nglobal demand grows. Madhavi is researching how\nto recycle lithium-ion batteries and other e-waste so that they can be\nreintegrated into the production cycle. There has to be a mind shift\ntowards a circular idea of economy. Otherwise, we will fall\ninto we, as in, the world will fall into a trap of, you know, we\nmight not have resources anymore. Nanyang\nTechnological University, alongside other prestigious\ninstitutions like Berkeley and Stanford, is among the world\u2019s most\nwell-regarded research hubs. It focuses on\ndeveloping tech that could be rapidly\ndeployed in future industry. This building on NTU\u2019s campus\nis called the Learning Hub and was designed specially\nfor Singapore\u2019s tropical climate. Its atrium is naturally\nventilated, which saves energy. I decided very early that batteries\nwould be my field of research. That was my\nPhD topic. I\u2019ve been doing\nbatteries my entire career, energy storage, circular\neconomy my entire career. From early on, I always\nwanted to do something that would make\nchange in people\u2019s lives. These are all shredded\nto something like this. You get the shredded\nbatteries and the black stuff that you see that is sticking here is\nwhere all the elements are present: lithium, nickel,\ncobalt, manganese. How do we\nextract them? We first physically separate\nthe black powders that are there and get what is\ncalled as a black mass. This black mass is what\nhas all the elements inside. The way we recover today, is\nby actually using orange peels, we just add orange peels to\nthe black powder or instead of that we add bacterial\ncultures to this black powder. So bacterial culture\nplus this black mass, we are able to extract all\nthe elements, about 99%. Madhavi\u2019s research is\naimed at making a closed loop where the use of\nentirely new materials can be reduced to\nan absolute minimum. Her innovations have\nresulted in thirty patents to date, and in 2019, she\nwas recognized as one of \u201cAsia's Top\nSustainability Superwomen.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of synergistic\neffort between materials research and circular\neconomy of materials. Today, both of them\nare done in silos, but I think there\u2019s\na lot of linkages and my research is\nreally trying to link. Back in Copenhagen, many\nof these practical experiments are being organized in a database\nto examine the most promising results. Tejs Vegge directs this center at\nthe Technical University of Denmark. Improbable approaches are oftentimes\nfollowed by fresh and innovative ideas. Pinpointing them and\nsharing recommendations with laboratories around the world\nis one core mission of the institute. I mean, the models that we develop\nhere are what we call physics aware, but they are also\nuncertainty aware. So they need to know\nwhen they don't know. And sometimes the best way of\ngathering additional information is actually not\nfrom the robot. It is from\nthe expert. It could be from the people\nthat work daily with the production of new battery materials,\ntheir specific insight to guide the\ndevelopment. So it's a\nmultinational, it's a multi-facility undertaking\nand it's also asynchronous. So it\u2019s, you could say, continuously\noperating around the world, 24/7, gathering the\ndata that\u2019s needed, controlling experiments and\nequipment at other places. It\u2019s really a global challenge\nand a global solution. It often takes two decades for basic\nresearch to reach industrial maturity. But amid the climate\ncrisis, time is of the essence. Solutions need to\nbe employed faster. It\u2019s an incredibly\ncomplex challenge so complex that applied\nresearch will need to adapt too. I would actually argue\nthat the main challenge and the main potential\nsolution lies in reinventing the way we invent new\nmaterials for the green transition. It's actually rethinking the\nway we do materials discovery, we do system\ndevelopment, and we need to\nreinvent the process itself and integrating all parts\nof the discovery production and end use\ncycle to do so. This is especially critical\nbecause the next innovations are already on the horizon: Professor\nHarry Atwater conducts research at the California\nInstitute of Technology. He\u2019s one of the\nworld's leading experts in the field of solar\nenergy conversion, turning sunlight into\nelectricity and heat. A relatively new branch\nof research is working to imitate nature's most fundamental\nenergy-harvesting process: photosynthesis. Nature has this marvelous capacity\nfor in the leaf of every plant of doing something\nthat\u2019s nearly miraculous, which is harvesting carbon dioxide from\nthe atmosphere together with water, in the presence\nof sunlight, and transforming those chemical\nreactants into complex sugars and starches that\nsustain life in a plant. Those complex sugars and\nstarches essentially are fuels. So we had drawn a huge\ninspiration from nature to envision a process we call\nartificial photosynthesis which uses engineered\nmaterials to perform the same kind of reduction\nand oxidation reactions that enable the formation\nof fuels directly from sunlight. Artificial photosynthesis mimics\nthis process that happens in nature. Instead of sunlight shining\non a leaf as it does in nature, researchers use structures made of intricately-manufactured\nsemiconductors. In other words,\nan artificial leaf. And with it, solar energy can turn\nwater into hydrogen and oxygen. The efficiency of artificial\nphotosynthesis is currently at 19.3% and was jointly\nachieved by laboratories in Pasadena, Ilmenau, and the\nFraunhofer Institute. If this process could be\nscaled up for industrial use, hydrogen would become\ncheaper than any other fuel. That\u2019s why research into\nartificial photosynthesis is being conducted\nworldwide. We\u2019re now talking\nabout the application of such semiconductor structures\nin a so-called \u2018artificial place\u2019 meaning, an integrated device that does\nnot need any wiring to the outside, similar to plants. So that we can basically\nproduce hydrogen and oxygen more or less from nothing,\njust through sunlight and water. Now for the first time,\nwe\u2019re in a position where we can essentially provide\nfree energy using photovoltaics the same way nature has been doing\nfor a very, very, very long time. And this has never\nbeen possible before. It's hard to overstate the\nsignificance of semiconductors. They\u2019re small\nand inconspicuous, but they are the basis of\nall advanced technologies. And can be made of many\ndifferent types of materials. Researchers at the\nTechnical University of Ilmenau work with so called\nthree-five semiconductors: III-V semiconductor compounds\nare ones we can design perfectly. Using silicon as\nthe base material that would of course\nbe extremely profitable. That\u2019s where high performance would\nmeet cheap materials and low costs. Of course, not every single\npart of these new energy systems is ready\nfor action. But rolling out innovation to\ncommunities and industries will be key. There are still many\nScientific breakthroughs and technological\ninnovations that have not yet been widely\nimplemented for public use. If you go through learning in\nsilos, like we did in the past, we will get there. But we will not\nget there on time. And we all know\nwhat it will cost us not to be there on time\nfrom a climate perspective. The hope for a circular system\nis the thing that propels us. Prosperity must be\nmade more sustainably. We didn't inherit this\nplanet from our parents, rather we\u2019re borrowing\nit from our children. Researchers have made\ntremendous strides in recent years. Technology has\ncome a long way. But successfully\ntransforming our energy supply to make it sustainable hinges on\nour ability to scale these solutions. They must be integrated\ninto large sectors of society before it\u2019s\ntoo late.",

        "Transcript": "Hi friends, and welcome back to the Kritter Korner and Animals 101! Are you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of animal conservation?! Today, we're going to unravel the mysteries of an animal's conservation status. I'm Hannah your safari guide and today we are going to learn all  about the world of conservation. So,\u00a0let's dive right in and answer the question: What exactly is an animal's conservation status?\" Conservation is the\u00a0\napplied science of protecting species,\u00a0\u00a0 habitats, and ecosystems. It seeks to\u00a0\nease human impact and ensure ecological\u00a0\u00a0 harmony for generations to come. But how do experts decide an\u00a0\u00a0 animal's conservation status? The process\u00a0\ninvolves thorough scientific assessment.\u00a0\u00a0 Conservationists gather data on population size\u00a0\n(how many of one species there are in the wild),\u00a0\u00a0 habitat quality (how healthy the animal\u2019s\u00a0\nhome is), and reproduction rates (how many\u00a0\u00a0 babies the species is having in the wild).\u00a0\nThis data combined with mathematical models\u00a0\u00a0 give us an animals conservation status.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the conservation\u00a0\u00a0 status scale that most scientists use today. In 1964, a group called the International\u00a0\u00a0 Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) started\u00a0\nsomething really important. They created a list,\u00a0\u00a0 kind of like a special report card, called\u00a0\nthe Red List of Threatened Species. This\u00a0\u00a0 list tells us if an animal is in danger\u00a0\nof disappearing forever from our planet.\u00a0 The IUCN recognizes seven statuses. Let\u2019s learn a little bit\nabout each of these statuses.\u00a0 Extinct (EX): This status sadly means\u00a0\nthe animal has disappeared completely.\u00a0\u00a0 It's important to remember extinct animals so\u00a0\nwe can learn from their story and make sure\u00a0\u00a0 other animals don't vanish like they did. Extinct in the Wild (EW):  This status means the animal doesn't live in their natural home\u00a0\nanymore. They might only exist in places like\u00a0\u00a0 zoos. Even though they are not found in the wild,\u00a0\u00a0 these species still have a chance with\u00a0\nspecial programs to help reintroduce them.\u00a0 Critically Endangered (CR): Think of this status\u00a0\nas a big alarm! It means this animal species is in really,\u00a0\u00a0 really big trouble. If we don't help them soon, they may disappear.  Endangered (EN): This status is a serious\u00a0warning. It's also telling us that this animal species is in danger\u00a0\nand needs our help.  They're needing a little\u00a0extra backup.  Vulnerable (VU): These animal\u00a0species are facing some problems, but if we step\u00a0\nin and help, they can make it through it.  Near Threatened (NT): This status is getting\u00a0\u00a0 ready for a challenge. The animal species might not\u00a0\nbe in big trouble yet, but they're starting\u00a0\u00a0 to face some problems. If we're careful, we\u00a0\ncan stop these problems from getting worse.\u00a0 Least Concern (LC): This status means the animal\u00a0species\nis doing pretty well. They're not facing any big\u00a0\u00a0 issues. But it's still important to keep an\u00a0\neye on them. These statuses help us understand which animal species\u00a0 need our help the most and which ones are doing\u00a0just fine.  Now, let's look at some real-life examples of species\u00a0\nteetering on the edge of survival.  The Amur leopard, the Hawaiian monk seal, and the polar\u00a0\nbear stand as sad symbols of 'endangered' status.\u00a0 The Amur leopard's dwindling population\u00a0\nis a consequence of habitat destruction, a result\u00a0\u00a0 of deforestation. The Hawaiian monk seal faces\u00a0\ndanger due to disruptions from human activities\u00a0\u00a0 invading their habitats. The polar bear's risky\u00a0\nsituation stems from the impact of climate change,\u00a0\u00a0 causing the arctic ice they rely on to melt. Conservation statuses help scientists create programs to help these animals in the wild, but\u00a0there are also things we can do at home to help these species. Small actions collectively\u00a0can\nyield tremendous impact. One thing we can all do is reduce our Carbon Footprint. When you leave a room,\u00a0turn off the lights. Unplug chargers and devices when they are not in use. Saving electricity helps cut\u00a0\ndown on the fossil fuels used to generate power.  2. Advocate for Sustainable Practices Be sure to spread the word: Talk to your friends, family, and\u00a0\nteachers about the importance of using reusable\u00a0\u00a0 items like water bottles, bags, and lunch\u00a0\ncontainers.  Support Eco-Friendly Brands: Encourage\u00a0\nyour family and friends to choose products that are\u00a0\u00a0 made sustainably and don't harm the environment.\u00a0\nThis might include items with recyclable packaging\u00a0\u00a0 or those that support renewable energy.\nMake sure to read your labels in the supermarket that will tell you whether or not an item is made sustainably  \n3. Supporting Conservation Initiatives Donate to Wildlife Organizations: Many\u00a0\nof the projects\u2019 scientists create\u00a0\u00a0 to help wildlife need funding.\u00a0\nWildlife conservation organizations are\u00a0\u00a0 always looking for financial support.\nIf you can\u2019t donate money,\u00a0\u00a0 maybe you can donate your time. Some\u00a0\nwildlife organizations have  volunteer opportunities.  You can also join community\u00a0\u00a0 events where people clean up parks, beaches,\u00a0\nor other natural areas. It's a hands-on way\u00a0\u00a0 to directly improve the environment.\nYou can be part of the solution\u00a0\u00a0 by reducing your carbon footprint, making sure you're living sustainably,  and helping spread the word about conservation.  Everyone can help make a difference. \nIn conclusion, my aspiring\u00a0\u00a0 conservationists, an animal's conservation\u00a0\nstatus mirrors the state of our interconnected\u00a0ecosystem.

        "Video_ID": "3F6mq20QOcE",
        "Transcript": "From Delhi to Istanbul to Los Angeles, air pollution is a big issue, especially in the world's biggest cities. \"It will decrease your lung function. It will increase asthma attacks. It will increase hospital admission...\" \"... contributes to seven million deaths a year.\" See all these pink dots? They show that in almost every major city in the world, the air is far dirtier than what the World Health Organization considers safe. When we dove into the data, though, we found some surprisingly good news. In many megacities, the air is getting better. So, we wondered: What are these cities doing right, and can every place do this? For this analysis, we looked at one measure of air pollution that's everywhere: PM 2.5. \"PM 2.5...\" PM stands for \"particulate matter\", a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets that are 2.5 microns or less \u2013 much smaller than a human hair. This is only one possible type of air pollution, but people like Sophie Gumy from the WHO use it as an indicator for air pollution in general. \"Because this is a pollutant that can come from various different sources. And it's ubiquitous in the world, so there is literally no place in the world that is free of particulate matter.\" And it's big cities that are often particularly polluted. This problem has been well known for years. To find out whether anything has changed, we took a closer look at this database from the Swiss company IQAir, which shows average levels of PM 2.5 for more than 7,000 cities over the past five years. We put it all into a big Excel spreadsheet and checked that against a list of the world's biggest cities, those with more than 10 million people living in them. Of those 25 cities, it seems like the air has gotten better in almost all of them \u2013 even where levels are still high. \"What we've seen is that on average about five percent improvement in air quality over the past few years.\" Zoe Chafe helps cities that want to tackle the air pollution problems. The causes are similar,  even when their proportions vary. \"Transportation emissions are often number one, not always. And then also just generally electricity use, people cooking with solid fuels in their homes in some parts of the world, heating with solid fuels. Another major source of air pollution is from industrial sources, and then also from waste.\" So here's what cities are doing to tackle these issues. For many cities, changing how people move around can make a big difference. Here's Sophie Gumy from the WHO again: \"There is a need, really a push, to really have cleaner vehicles, but also fewer vehicles, to really promote walking, cycling and providing also public transportation with electric vehicles.\" Take Bangkok, for instance. The city is working on expanding its \u2013 still limited \u2013 Skytrain and Metro services. And in the meantime, electric alternatives for the traditional combustion-engine TukTuks let people get around emission-free as well. Delhi is working on electrifying 80% of its bus fleet. And even in Kolkata, sometimes called the \"diesel capital of the world\", alternatives like this electric scooter service are starting up. The next step, Zoe Chafe says, can be introducing so-called \"low-emission zones\" \"Cities that are restricting emissions in a certain part of their city both to improve air quality, but also to improve quality of life.\" This might mean only allowing cleaner cars to enter, or no cars at all. And it might mean transforming streets to make more room for pedestrians or bicyclists. \"This is something that's resonating across all regions of the world right now, and it's really exciting.\" From Times Square in New York City being converted to a pedestrian area, to reducing traffic in Kampala or Belo Horizonte, to more bike lanes in Paris or Pune: cities everywhere are experimenting with a different kind of urban design. Transport is not the only area cities must tackle. Delhi's action plan against air pollution also focuses on industry: by measuring and reducing the dust from construction sites, and having more industries shift to cleaner fuels and more efficient techniques, like converting traditional brick kilns to zigzag kilns. This is something a lot of cities are doing, like here in Lahore, Pakistan. The method still uses coal, but much less of it, and it traps more of the particular matter inside the kiln, lowering its emissions. One reason for Delhi's slightly better air these days might be that in 2018, the city shut down the Badarpur coal power plant, which was responsible for around ten percent of the city's particulate matter air pollution alone. One area where progress is still slow is waste. \"So there are these solid waste management bylaws from 2016. They are still not implemented.\" Bhavreen Kandhari has been advocating for cleaner air for more than 20 years. She founded the mothers' activist group Warrior Moms, who campaign against air pollution by petitioning the government and courts throughout India. She says even when the right policies are there, the government often doesn't follow through. \"We do not segregate our waste at source, and mostly it's all mixed, and that is what is making those huge landfills, and the mixed waste is incinerated in the middle of a city.\" Without organized waste collection, burning is often the only option for getting rid of unwanted materials, causing toxic smoke full of harmful particulate matter that can stretch for miles. So preventing waste, as well as collecting and disposing of it better has to be part of any city's plan to curb air pollution. When policies are implemented thoroughly, that can have a big impact. Take Beijing, for instance. A decade ago it consistently made headlines for its toxic smog cover. But in the last few years it has massively reduced its pollution levels. And it's not just Beijing: Many of China's megacities have improved a lot recently. This is the result of what the Chinese government calls a \"war on air pollution\" that focused on all of the causes we've already mentioned, but not least on energy, on how people cook, and heat their homes. The city of Beijing imposed tight limits on emissions from boilers used in people's homes and subsidized anyone who wanted to upgrade their coal-fired boiler to natural gas \u2013 which is still a fossil fuel but produces much less particulate matter \u2013 or to electricity which could be produced by renewables. Studies show that twenty percent of the reduction in Beijing's pollution just came from renovating these coal-fired boilers. Outside of China as well, countries around the world are investing in renewable energy, phasing out coal from the energy supply in favour of solar, wind and others. Countries like Poland are also getting rid of their coal and wood fired stoves. And Seoul in South Korea, which already swapped coal heaters for gas back in the 1990s, is now discussing the switch to more eco-friendly heat pumps. For cooking, stoves fired with wood or kerosene are still the only option in many parts of the world, especially in rural areas without access to electricity. But projects from Pakistan to Rwanda to the Himalayas are introducing cleaner stove models to those regions as well. Whether and how fast cities can implement change comes down to a few things. And the first hurdle is better data. Take Lahore in Pakistan. It regularly tops lists of the world's most polluted cities. According to the data, it looks like it has improved, at least a little, but it's hard to say whether any actual change has happened. \"We haven't really seen any trends that would explain why the numbers are going down. So I think it's just that the quality of data improved.\" This is Abid Omar. In 2016, he founded the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative. Which is a community initiative where like-minded individuals, corporations, organizations have come together with low-cost monitors and are providing that data publicly on the internet on various platforms. And that data is what is driving awareness. In Pakistan, there are very few air quality monitors set up by the government. This makes it hard to judge whether things are actually getting better. Thanks to Abid's initiative, though, there are now more than a dozen sensors in Lahore alone showing the current air pollution levels, making it harder for governments and citizens to ignore the issue. And better monitoring systems have sprung up everywhere in the past few years. \"Cities are increasing their ability to monitor their air quality and this is something that is extremely important, a very positive trend from our perspective.\" Then there's the question of money. \"Beijing was able to put a huge amount of investment into the air quality problem. And that is the key question for a lot of other cities right now: Do they have the money to invest to make such a step change in their air quality?\" And last but not least, there's a political hurdle: Collaboration. \"So if you imagine air flowing together over parts of the world, that's what we call an air shed. It doesn't respect political boundaries. And so in a place like Delhi, it's extremely important that neighbouring cities and jurisdictions work together on their common problem.\" Crop stubble burning brings intense smog to northern India, including Delhi, every year after the harvest season. And the same problem happens, for example, in Cairo or across Indonesia, where smoke clouds can reach so far they affect the air in Singapore and parts of Malaysia. So cities, regions and countries will have to work together to change. \"Because if what we have at the heart of the matter is the health of the people living in a city, it doesn't really matter where the air pollution is coming from. It's extremely important that it's reduced.\" So air pollution is still a huge issue. Big cities all over the world are pretty far from what the WHO considers safe, which would be below five micrograms per cubic meter of air. But it can get better. \"So that's why I tell people when they get so disappointed, I say: it's taken me decades, you know, for us, people like us, to be fighting this here in the courts and coming such a long way. Changes happen. Social changes are never easy.\" And even when really good air is far away, any change helps. \"Any reduction in air pollution is good for health. Any small reduction is good.\" What's more is that the things that clean up air are also good for combating climate change, which is likewise fueled by emissions from burning waste and fossil fuels.

International Energy agency confirmed in its world energy Outlook publication that electricity generated from solar panels was cheaper than that generated from coal and gas in most countries around the world Nations and individuals have warmed up to the idea of using solar energy to meet their energy demands with large scale and individual solar installations seeing a sharp uptick in recent years switching energy sourcing from fossil fuels to solar energy could surely help reduce carbon emissions but won't be the ultimate Planet saving move that many believed it would one day be there are still many hurdles to overcome with this technology including issues with panel manufacturer and Mater materials the lifespan and waste generated energy storage and transportation and localized climate change possibilities the question is are we creating a green future or are we creating future problems the sun is a massive source of energy the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium releases tremendous amounts of energy into space a fraction of which is received by Earth estimates suggest that this fraction is about 174,000 tatt hours of energy but around half of this or roughly 83,000 tatt hours actually hits the ground in comparison the global electricity consumption in 2022 was a little over 24,000 ter hours so if we were to capture energy from all the sunlight that hits the ground we would cover the world's electricity demand and have twofold as much spare another form of this thought experiment is to cover large deserts such as the Sahara with solar panels and use the electricity captured to power other parts of the world with clean green energy solar energy solutions are ideal for solving our energy wos but when one considers their practicality the shortcomings of solar energy technology become apparent on the face of it solar panels are made from the second most abundant material on the planet silicon the popular semiconductor material makes up 27.7% of the world's crust by mass however silicon alone is not enough for solar panels to work electricity generated by solar panels needs to be conducted to the storage unit a job done using conducting materials such as copper and silver to to make solar panels cost effective they need to be produced at a large scale usually done by using Technologies like thin film photovoltaics the production of thin film solar cells requires rare metals like cadmium torrium indium and others in contrast to silicon's wide availability tum makes up only 0.00001% of the Earth's crust large-scale production of solar panels requires larger amounts of cadmium and tum which is not only an availability issue but also a geopolitical one in 2011 prices of certain rare earth materials shot up by as much as 750 in a single year after China clamped down on their production the Asian giant either produces or was involved in the processing and production of 97% of Rare Earth and minerals on the planet and its policies have a direct impact on the production of clean energy technology much of the growth in the adoption of solar technology around the world has been fueled by the production capabilities of Industries based in China the clean energy industry has enjoyed government support in the form of subsidies and favorable policies but that is now set for a major change after the Chinese government announced a new regulatory regime that will roll back subsidy loads and make the industry less profitable this could push the prices of solar panels higher once again making them less attractive to potential buyers a policy change would not necessarily happen solely for economic reasons China's dominance in manufacturing and Technology development in recent years has boosted its Ambitions on the global political stage however its tensions with the US have left the global supply chain on tenter Hooks and at high risk of falling apart due to political moves large scale plans to start solar energy Farms anywhere in the world can come to a grinding halt if the supply of components from China stops abruptly even if the Chinese dominance in the supply chain were carefully mitigated solar energy installation and usage comes with its own problems even after Decades of technological development solar panels power conversion efficiency is around 25% at best with large amounts of sunlight remaining untappable by technology solar Farms have no other option but to increase the scale of installation to generate large power output estimates from the solar energy industry Association or SE suggest that it takes anywhere between 5 and 7 acres of land to generate just one megawatt of solar energy conservative estimates peg this number much higher to 10 acres other clean energy sources like wind turbines have a completely lower land use requirement moreover the land remains available for other purposes such as residential or agricultural [Music] use countries with limited land availability find it difficult to adopt solar energy as a clean energy solution with priority given to agriculture or industrial usage of available land even in areas where large Parcels of land are available for solar energy installations the energy generated from the power plant has limited applications photovoltaic panels convert solar energy into electricity which can be used to power the grid however industrial applications such as high temperature furnaces or L Hall transport cannot be powered by solar panels since solar is an intermittent source of energy usually unavailable for at least half of the day electricity produced during the brighter parts of the day needs to be stored somewhere to be used when the demand for electricity is high electrochemical batteries which use chemicals like lead have been used in the past but as the size of solar plants has increased batteries with higher energy storage capacity are in demand lithium ion batteries are the best technological solution available for this but they are also extremely expensive to deploy at large scales although solar energy might be effectively free to harvest the initial setup of solar panels and energy storage solutions is expensive this is the basic reason solar energy isn't being harvested in the world's deserts and shipped to the rest of the world let's examine this in more detail installing solar panels in deserts would eliminate all the land use issues associated with solar energy and extract energy from areas where the sun shines the most quite literally a typical photovoltaic panel installed in a solar farm produces 350 Watts over 50 billion such panels would need to be manufactured to meet the world's energy demand these 50 billion panels would cover an area of 11 15,625 Square mil since the Sahara Desert alone has an area of over 3.6 million square miles this whole experiment could be centralized there moving from the thought experiment to bringing this into reality one begins to see the hurdles in getting this done on average installation costs for a 350 wat panel along with the mounts and infrastructure are about $700 doing so in the Sahara would definitely cost a bit more at a 50% premium let's round it off at $1,000 installing 50 billion panels at this price would balloon the project cost to $50 trillion which is nearly 18 times the size of the US economy but the project would be useless if it did not have the equivalently large battery pack connected to it at current energy storage costs that would be around $900 for each panel practically doubling the cost of the project that's over 30 times the size of the US economy even if we did manage to fund such a project the energy generated would still need to be sent to different parts of the world so there is the additional cost of building a global grid but we also know sending electricity over the wires involves transmission losses the further away from the Sahara the country is the more energy it will lose by the time it receives its electricity Supply making it highly inefficient even if we were still to proceed with the plan the presence of 50 billion panels over the desert would also cool the area this would return rain to the area likely increase vegetation and cover the panels prompting a shift in the location of such a power plant if a mitigation strategy were put in place to avoid this one inevit ability remains solar panels eventually reach the end of their life cycle and need replacement this brings us to the last part of our problem disposing of solar panels the upti in solar installations might be good news for the planet in terms of preventing fossil fuel usage but also spells impending doom a few years down the line taking into account that solar panels work for three decades before they need to be replaced one presumption that the problem will become a major one by 2050 or thereabouts plenty of time to come up with a solution however commercial solar installations have been in place for well over two decades according to estimates by the international renewable energy agency large amounts of solar panel waste will begin piling up as early as 2030 the peak of solar energy waste may be in the 2050s but is expected to be a colossal 78 million tons imagine a pile of solar waste if 50 billion panels were installed in the Sahara a Harvard Business Review report pointed out that irena's predictions assume that users will continue using their panels until the end of their lifespan before replacing them however improvements in energy conversion efficiency could prompt users to dump their panels earlier in favor of energy efficient ones bringing forward the problem of solar waste the long life cycle of solar panels has discouraged investment in recycling even though panel production uses some expensive metals like silver and copper these are present in very small amounts processes for their recovery are complex require hazardous chemicals like strong acids and increase the cost of recycling the panel in comparison sending the panel to a landfill is way cheaper however the a number of panels that will be at the end of their lives in the next decade makes this untenable the presence of heavy metals like cadmium and lead in the panel also adds a layer of complexity to the disposal problem all in all turning to solar energy as the planet's Ultimate Energy Solution is a massive mistake one could make right from production of the panels to their disposal the solar energy is riddled with problems that magnify with increasing scale however future solutions to these problems cannot be discounted from a cost standpoint at least the $90 million Tesla provided hornsdale power Reserve in South Australia paid for itself in 2.5 years and is currently making good profit this is the largest battery plant in the world which deals with the excessive power generation that's being pumped back into the grid from rooftop solar panels in the area the initial cost however doesn't factor in the panels themselves as these are privately owned this was a program set up to manage issues with existing power infrastructure rather than building an entirely new one so cannot be compared to the Sahara concept one:1 it also doesn't address the waste manufactur or geopolitical issues associated with the tech either action is needed now to mitigate these issues if we don't want significant problem in the future one could also argue that the problem isn't so much the technology we use as our Hunger for More Energy and more things we want the same kind of growth that fossil fuels made possible even though we are aware of the harm they have caused to the planet as a civilization we do not want to

In\u00a0\nrecent years, there has been growing interest\u00a0\u00a0 in green technology as a way to address the\u00a0\nchallenges of climate change and promote\u00a0\u00a0 sustainable development. In this essay, we\u00a0\nwill discuss the advantages and challenges\u00a0\u00a0 of green technology, and its potential to\u00a0\ncontribute to a more sustainable future.\u00a0 Advantages of Green Technology: Green technology\u00a0\nhas several advantages over traditional\u00a0\u00a0 technologies. One of the main advantages is\u00a0\nthat it is more environmentally friendly. Green\u00a0\u00a0 technologies use renewable energy sources such as\u00a0\nwind, solar, and hydro power, which do not produce\u00a0\u00a0 greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on\u00a0\nnon-renewable resources such as fossil fuels.\u00a0 Green technology also has the potential to\u00a0\ncreate new industries and job opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0 The development and deployment of green\u00a0\ntechnologies require new skills and knowledge,\u00a0\u00a0 which can create jobs in fields such as\u00a0\nengineering, construction, and renewable energy.\u00a0 Another advantage of green technology is that it\u00a0\ncan help reduce energy costs. Renewable energy\u00a0\u00a0 sources are becoming increasingly competitive with\u00a0\ntraditional sources of energy, and can help reduce\u00a0\u00a0 energy bills for households and businesses.\nChallenges of Green Technology: While green\u00a0\u00a0 technology has many advantages, it also faces\u00a0\nseveral challenges. One of the main challenges\u00a0\u00a0 is the initial cost of developing and deploying\u00a0\ngreen technologies. Many green technologies are\u00a0\u00a0 still in the early stages of development, and\u00a0\nrequire significant investment to bring to market.\u00a0\u00a0 This can make them less competitive with\u00a0\ntraditional technologies in the short term.\u00a0 Another challenge is the need for\u00a0\ninfrastructure to support green technologies.\u00a0\u00a0 Renewable energy sources such as wind and\u00a0\nsolar require specific infrastructure such\u00a0\u00a0 as wind turbines and solar panels, which\u00a0\ncan be expensive to install and maintain.\u00a0 Green technology also faces regulatory challenges,\u00a0\nsuch as lack of policy support and incentives.\u00a0\u00a0 Governments play a critical role\u00a0\nin supporting the development and\u00a0\u00a0 deployment of green technologies through\u00a0\npolicies such as tax incentives, grants,\u00a0\u00a0 and regulations that encourage\u00a0\nthe use of renewable energy.\u00a0 Potential of Green Technology: Despite the\u00a0\nchallenges, green technology has the potential\u00a0\u00a0 to contribute to a more sustainable future.\u00a0\nGreen technologies can help reduce greenhouse\u00a0\u00a0 gas emissions and promote sustainable development\u00a0\nby reducing reliance on non-renewable resources.\u00a0 Green technology can also provide economic\u00a0\nbenefits, such as job creation and reduced\u00a0\u00a0 energy costs. By investing in green technologies,\u00a0\ncountries can create new industries and export\u00a0\u00a0 opportunities in fields such as renewable\u00a0\nenergy and sustainable transportation.\u00a0 Conclusion: Green technology is a rapidly\u00a0\ngrowing field that has the potential to\u00a0\u00a0 address the challenges of climate change\u00a0\nand promote sustainable development.\u00a0\u00a0 While it faces several challenges such as\u00a0\ninitial costs and lack of infrastructure,\u00a0\u00a0 the benefits of green technology are significant.\u00a0\u00a0 By investing in green technologies and\u00a0\nsupporting policies and incentives, countries\u00a0\u00a0 can create a more sustainable future while also\u00a0\npromoting economic growth and job creation.",

        "Transcript": "Voiceover: When you step back and look\nat the sociology content here, you might be wondering how in the world any of\nthis applies to medicine. You might say, it has nothing to do with\nthe physical health of a person, so why do you need to know\nall of this? Why do these social theories and social\nstructures matter to someone in the field of\nmedicine? Let's go through the different theories\nand figure this out. First off, we have functionalism. Remember, functionalism is the theory that\ndifferent institutions in a society adjust to minor changes to keep the\nsociety stable and functioning. If we look at the function of medicine in society from a functionalist point of\nview. We're asking what is the purpose of\nmedicine. Well when people become ill medicine\nensures that they return to a functional state, so they can\ncontribute to society. Being sick is detrimental to the well\nbeing of the society as a whole and when you're sick people can\nusually tell. They tell you to go home and get better. The assumption is that you're not supposed to participate in society when you're\nsick. This upsets the stability of the society\non a small scale at least. The doctor is there to get you better\nagain, so you can get back to participating in\nsociety. On a bigger scale, the institution of\nmedicine helps us stabilize the social system in emergency situations like hurricanes or earthquakes, where\nhospitals and medical professionals take over large\nspaces like school gyms to provide the medical assistance needed by\nthe many people who are injured. In day-to-day life medicine helps to\nimprove the quality of life for the aging population, allowing them to\ncontribute to society for longer. Okay, that seems to make sense. Medicine keeps people healthy and\nparticipating in society. What about conflict theory? How do conflicting groups in a society\naffect the health of an individual? As we know, conflict theory is all about\nthe inequality between different groups. In the case of medicine, this could have quite a significant impact on who has\naccess to medical care, meaning both access to\nhospitals and the ability to be covered by\ninsurance. Wealthier citizens can pay for the best\nmedical care, but people that are scraping by cannot afford\nhospital bills without insurance. Sometimes people can afford health\ninsurance when it isn't provided by their employer or they\ncan't afford the deductibles, so they skip the\nhospital visit and try to heal on their own. Meaning they are sick for longer or\nperhaps they never get better. The unequal access to valuable resources\nin society, like education, housing or well-paying jobs, leads to health\ndisparities and limited access to medical care. Even the power struggle between different\ninterest groups can affect the health of an\nindividual. Take a look at air pollution regulations. Factories want more lax regulations to\nreduce costs, while the people living near those factories want stricter\nregulations for their own health and well being. Asthma rates rise in areas with higher\nlevels of particulate matter in the air. Stricter air pollution regulations keep\nthe residents healthier, in terms of asthma rates at least, but put a dent in the\nincome of factories. All right, two down. Let's take a look at the theory of social\nconstructionism now. In case you forgot, social constructionism\nis the idea that society gives value to\neverything. A diamond was just a rock until society\nagreed that it should have value. In regards to medicine, it means that as a\nsociety, we have attached different meanings to different behaviors,\nand we have different preconceptions of\ndifferent people. In short it means stereotypes, we have\nassumptions about people based on their appearance or actions and we treat people differently because of those\nassumptions. We have preconceptions about different\nraces, ages, genders, even subcultures like medal\nheads. In the past, if we saw someone talking to\nthemselves on the street we would assume they were mentally unstable\nso we would give them a wide berth. Today, we know people might be talking on\na Bluetooth device and so we assume they\naren't crazy. Assumptions can be very dangerous to a\nmedical professional. They can affect how you treat your patient\nor your diagnosis. But interaction between the patient and\nthe doctor is influenced by stereotype assumptions on\nboth sides. Perhaps the patient feels some symptom is\nnot important enough to mention to the doctor or perhaps the doctor makes a false assumption based on how the patient\nappears. Assumptions also affect how the health\nsystem views the patient. There are people who argue that someone\nwho can't afford health care doesn't deserve it because\nthey don't work hard enough. You can't declare a characteristic of a\nperson based on their circumstance. There are people who don't work who can\nstill afford health care, while some people work hard at minimum\nwage who can't spare the money. You also have to be aware of\nmedicalization, where patients or doctors will construct an illness out\nout ordinary behavior. A child who can't sit still in class\ndoesn't necessarily have ADD. They might just need to get out on the\nplayground and run. Now that we know to be aware of social\nbased assumptions, let's check out how symbolic\ninteractionism applies to medicine. Remember the symbolic interactionism\nstates that individuals give the world meaning by interacting with\nit. One person could consider a bridge a way\nto cross over a body of water, while another person considers\nit a good shelter from the rain. There are many ways we can see how this\napplies to medicine. Let's take a look at two. For one, we have the doctor-patient\nrelationship. The meaning given to simple objects, like\na lab coat or a stethoscope, can affect the\ninteraction. It is important for the doctor to realize\nthe meaning the patient's given to the tools\nof medicine. The patient may see the lab coat as a sign\nof authority, giving the doctor the power to\ndiagnose and treat them. Is the stethoscope a way for the doctor to\nconnect with the patient, or is it just a tool that\ndecorates a doctor's neck? Second, we have the changes in society. Recently, there has been a medicalization\nof society, where everything from beauty to just being fidgety now has\na medical fix. Standards of beauty have encouraged many people to undergo unnecessary plastic\nsurgery. People can choose to have C-sections when\ngiving birth. Which can effect both the mother and child\nlater in life. Normal behaviors are being shown as\nillnesses. One of the most prevalent examples of illness manufacturing is in the case of\ndepression. While depression is a serious condition it's importance and severity have been\nmarginalized. It seems like every other person today is\ndepressed. When you're sad, society views that as\nthere being something wrong with you, but in reality sadness is a\nnatural biological function. We're suppose to be sad sometimes. All right, let's take a look at something\na bit more specific. Feminist theory is an offshoot of conflict\ntheory that focuses on the inequalities between men\nand women in society. These inequalities are pretty apparent\nwhen looking at the field of medicine. Though the admittance of women into med\nschool is on the rise, it is still am male-dominated\nfield. The heads of hospitals and doctors in\ngeneral still tend to be men. There's a disparity in the jobs and salary\nbetween male and female doctors. Men more often occupy higher paid\npositions. Women are more often found in family\nmedicine rather than specialized fields. This disparity in health care positions\ntranslates into a disparity in power. If you take a look at medicine from the\nperspective of rational choice and exchange theories, you can\nobserve big worldview issues of power. Rational choice and exchange theory assume\nthat people behave rationally according to\ntheir best interests. And that you can break down any social institution into the self-interest of\ninteractions between individuals. So, let's see how this applies. When you look at the medical system as a\nwhole, you can ask, what is the purpose of the\nmedical system? Does it really exist to keep people\nhealthy or is there some other reason? Perhaps it\u2019s a capitalist competition to\nearn the most money. Perhaps the structure of our medical\nsystem benefits private companies more than it does the sick people that it\u2019s\nsupposed to be helping. People run every aspect of the medical\nsystem and those people will make decisions that benefit\nthemselves more than a random sick stranger. And perhaps, that effects why people go to\nthe doctor or not when they're sick. Will going to the doctor benefit them the\nmost in the long run? Or will it cost them an arm and a leg? Some people avoid doctor visits for minor things, because they can not afford the\nexpense. But that could allow something that could\nbe easily treated to become a much larger\nproblem. The self interested behavior people in\ncharge of different aspects of the medical system will trickle down to eventually\neffect the well being of a patient. Well look at that bridging the gap between\nsociology and medicine seemed a near impossible task when we started but\nnow we have quite a few examples. To be honest, there are probably so many more ways that sociology's involved\nin medicine. Let's take a look outside the specific\ntheories too. Where you live can affect you health. There are urban areas called food deserts,\nwhere there are no grocery stores within a\nreasonable distance. The only places to eat are fast food\nrestaurants or, perhaps, grabbing a snack at a gas\nstation. It is nearly impossible to get the\nnutrition a body needs from only these sources, and malnutrition can\nlead to a host of other problems. Some neighborhoods have no gyms or playgrounds, nowhere for residents to\nexercise. You can use these examples to come up with\nyour own examples of other places where\nsociology applies to medicine.",

        "Transcript": "(upbeat music) Before we\nbegin we'd like to add a quick warning discretion. This video discusses mental illness including eating disorders and PTSD. What is mental illness? According to National\nAlliance on Mental Illness, it's defined as a condition that affects a person's thinking, feeling or mood for a sustained period of time\nthat negatively impacts them. You might be wondering, is\ndepression a mental illness? What about anxiety? Yes, they are. In fact, they're the most common\ntypes of mental illnesses. In this video, Psych2go covers 10 of the most common types\nof mental illnesses. One, anxiety disorders. We know 18.1% doesn't sound\nlike a lot but that's the number of adults in the US who\nsuffer from anxiety disorders. 40 million people suffer from symptoms of an anxiety disorder every year. Of those 40 million people, it's estimated that only 36.9% of them will get help. Anxiety disorders rarely appear alone, with depression being\na common co-diagnosis. Anxiety disorders come in a few varieties, generalized anxiety disorder,\nGAD, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, SAD and obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD. So, what do all these anxiety\ndisorders have in common? They're all characterized by\nnearly uncontrollable worry that messes with several\naspects of daily life such as sleep, relationships,\nschool and work. The good news is there are\nseveral treatment options available, which include different types of therapy and medication. Two, personality disorders. What does it mean when someone's\npersonality is disordered? Personality disorders refer\nto behavioral, emotional and thought patterns that deviate greatly from the expectations of\nan individualist culture. The National Institute\nof Mental Health suggests that 9.1 of the population has the traits of a personality disorder. So what does this look like in real life? Could anyone who's a little\ndifferent be diagnosed with a personality disorder? Well, according to the\ndiagnostic criteria in the DSMV these differences must\nbe causing the individual significant amounts of distress in the way they see themselves,\nothers and situations, inappropriate or exaggerated\nemotional responses, impulse control and how well\nthe individual relates to and functions around others. Personality disorders can't\nbe cured but thankfully they can be treated. This treatment consists of\ncombinations of medications for the underlying mental health issues as well as talk therapy. Three, attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder. If we say ADHD what comes to mind? The stereotype of a\nperson diagnosed with ADHD is usually a small child\nwho's bouncing off the walls or can't finish a task. However, between 7.8 and 11%\nof children aged four to 17 are diagnosed with ADHD any given year. ADHD affects people of\nall ages and includes multiple symptoms such as\ninability to concentrate, forgetfulness, inability\nability to sit still, restlessness and losing things. An individual's symptoms\nvary depending on their age, gender and type of ADHD. Did you know there's actually three recognized types of ADHD? There ADHD, combined type ADHD, impulsive/hyperactive type in ADHD, inattentive and destructible type. Most people think meds are\nthe only way to control ADHD. Well many people diagnosed\nwith the disorder find relief by using a combination of\nmedications, life coaching, education and talk therapy. Four, post traumatic stress disorder. Did you know that an estimated\n6.8% of the US population will develop some form of post\ntraumatic stress disorder. That's about 19 million\npeople in the US alone. So how does this happen? You, me, everybody will get stressed out by something in our lives. Some people will come across\nsomething so stressful that it affects them permanently. For many of them this\nstress becomes trauma. A traumatic event is considered any event that should not have happened,\nsuch as a natural disaster an assault, childhood neglect,\nabuse, starvation and so on. Just as a completely\nnormal reaction to trauma what will happen when the threat is gone? The stress and trauma stops\non its own for most people, when the mind and body\nunderstand the individual is no longer under attack. But what if the mind and\nbody don't get the memo? Post traumatic stress disorder\nrefers to a prolonged fight or flight response that happens after the stressful event has stopped. Complex post traumatic\nstress disorder, CPTSD refers to the PTSD that\noccurs due to a series of continued traumatic events,\nsuch as childhood abuse. Think of PTSD and CPTSD as the echoes of the stress response. These echoes can happen in the\nform of emotional flashbacks, nightmares, extreme anxiety or panic, difficulties connecting to others and an overwhelming sense of fear. So how does someone get help\nfor something so overwhelming? People suffering from PTSD\nor CPTSD can find relief through trauma therapies, which is eye movement\ndesensitization reprocessing EMDR or traditional talk therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT or dialectical behavior therapy, DBT. Five, depression. An estimated 6.7% of the US population over the age of 18 15.7 million people live with depression. Although the occasional low\nmood is a normal response to negative situations,\ndepression entails low moods that are severe and last\nlonger than six weeks. Depression manifests\ndifferently in women than men. Women tend to experience\ndepression as feelings of sadness, worthlessness and shame or guilt. Men tend to mistake the symptoms\nof depression as fatigue and being easily irritated. Common treatments for depression include cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT, interpersonal therapy,\nIPT, psychodynamic therapy, psycho education groups, antidepressants and various brain stimulation therapies. Six, bipolar disorder. An estimated 2.8% of the US population that sought mental health\ntreatment was diagnosed with some form of\nbipolar disorder in 2018. This number may be low, as\nmany individuals who suffer from any mental health\ndisorder do not seek treatment. Bipolar disorder means\na lot more than just really bad mood swings\nfor a couple of reasons. First people diagnosed\nwith bipolar disorder cannot completely\ncontrol these mood swings and in second, these mood\nswings range from manic, feeling super happy or invincible, doing crazy spontaneous\nthings, grandiosity and having racing or unrealistic thoughts to extreme bouts of depression and maybe a little hypomania in between. Living with bipolar disorder isn't easy but people struggling with the disorder can find a variety of medications and traditional counseling treatments to help them find more balance. Seven, eating disorders. Did you know there are\nalmost as many people living with eating disorders as there are with bipolar disorder? It's true. Approximately 2.7% of\nindividuals who sought treatment were diagnosed with an\neating disorder in 2018. The most common question people\nask about eating disorders is what's the difference\nbetween not being happy with your body and having\nan eating disorder? Well, in addition to this total focus on their physical flaws,\neating disorders are defined by dysmorphia and the binge purge restrict cycle of behavior. This cycle comes from\nthe person's feelings of extreme distress and\ndisgust about their body. This disgust drives the\nindividual who has the disorder to become super focused on\ntheir body weight and shape. Leave a comment below\nif you wanna know more about the binge purge restrict cycle. The eating disorders everyone knows about are anorexia nervosa and\nbulimia but most people have never heard of eating disorders not otherwise specified, EDNOS or avoidant restrictive\nfood intake disorder, ARFID. Leave a comment below\nif you wanna hear more about the lesser known eating disorders. Everyone needs food, so how is someone who has such a terrible\nrelationship with eating and body image supposed to get better? Recovery from an eating\ndisorder is totally possible. With a combination of talk\ntherapy, residential treatment and medications to treat the symptoms of any underlying mental\nhealth conditions. Eight, obsessive compulsive disorder. If obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD is a type of anxiety disorder, why does it make the number eight spot? Simple professionals\nday 2.3% of individuals will qualify for a diagnosis of OCD during the course of their lifetime. What's the first thing you\nthink of when you think of someone who suffers from\nobsessive compulsive disorder? Did you imagine someone who can't stand the thought of germs? Maybe a person who turns\nthe doorknob 27 times before they can leave the house? The common stereotype of an individual diagnosed with obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, OCD is if someone obsessed with cleaning or counting to a comical degree but that's not the whole picture. The reality of OCD includes\na great deal of anxiety, rigid thinking and feeling\nisolated from others. Individuals diagnosed with OCD suffer from reoccurring thoughts\nthat they cannot control, which are referred to as obsessions. These obsessions can be things\nlike cleaning or accounting but also include checking\nand double checking, feeling as though one will be\npunished for being a sinner. Organizing and arranging and hoarding. Having obsessions is different\nfrom being detail oriented or a little type A because individuals who suffer from obsessions\nexperience crippling anxiety due to these thoughts\nthey're unable to control. The compulsions are the\nactions such as cleaning, hand washing, arranging and\nhoarding, individuals use to cope with overwhelming\nanxiety and rigid thinking. So what is someone who lives\nwith the reality of OCD to do? Although there's no cure for\nOCD, a combination of medical and talk therapy will help them manage their symptoms effectively. Nine, autism spectrum disorder ASD. We've been hearing more and more about autism spectrum disorder\nASD in recent years. That's because approximately\n1.2% of children, one in 59 children will\nqualify for a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder\nin the coming year. ASD begins in childhood\nbut many individuals are not diagnosed until\nadolescence or adulthood. ASD is characterized by\nsignificantly impaired social interactions,\nlearning and communication. Individuals with ASD may seem eccentric or unemotional to others,\nas they do not understand normal social cues. Some of these behaviors include seeming off in their own world, repetitive thoughts or\nbehaviors, restricted interests, poor eye contact and difficulty\ncommunicating with others to the point their functioning\nis greatly impaired. The most common treatments for ASD include special education classes, applied behavioral analysis, ABA therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, behavioral management, therapy\nand medication management. And 10, schizophrenia\nand psychotic disorders. Did you know three out of\n100 people will experience the symptoms of psychosis\nin their lifetime? Yep, this means 1% of the population suffers from a psychotic disorder. People usually have their\nfirst psychotic break between the ages of 16 and 30 which means approximately\n100000 adolescents and adults will experience their first\npsychotic break every year. This does not mean everyone\nwho experiences psychosis will always have a psychotic disorder. Medical and environmental\nor situational factors such as extreme stress,\ncertain prescriptions and illicit drugs can\ninduce temporary psychosis. For individuals with a\npsychotic disorder however, the symptoms last longer than six months. So, what is psychosis anyway? Someone suffering from\npsychosis has breaks or disruptions in their reality, which manifests in behaviors\nsuch as religious delusions, audio visual or tactile hallucinations, feelings of paranoia or persecution and disordered or jumbled\nthoughts and speech. Schizophrenia is the most\ncommon psychotic disorder but the DSMV recognize a few others. Would you like to know more about the other psychotic disorders? Then tell us in the comments below. Having a psychotic disorder\ncan feel like torture but it doesn't have to. Many people who are diagnosed\nwith some type of psychosis are successfully treated\nwith a combination of specialized medications,\ntherapy and case management.

        "Transcript": "Hello again viewers! We all know that the food we eat often\u00a0\nprovides us with essential nutrients. In this video, we are going to talk about the six\u00a0\u00a0 basic nutrients that you get from\u00a0\nyour food and their functions. Let's get started with the nutrient,\u00a0\nwhich dominates more than 60% of our body. Yes, we are talking about \u2026 Water Even if you decide to go on a diet and not\u00a0\neat any proper meals, you can still survive. Although, you won\u2019t make it without water. For every organ of your body to\u00a0\nwork properly, you need water. This liquid helps in your brain function,\u00a0\nand cleanses your body of toxins. The cells in your body stay\u00a0\nhydrated because of water. Apart from that, water also helps\u00a0\nin the process of digestion. If you are someone who doesn't\u00a0\ndrink water regularly, you might\u00a0\u00a0 find yourself constipated more often than not. If you aren't drinking water properly,\u00a0\nyou will end up becoming dehydrated. That is not good for your body as it can\u00a0\naffect its mental and physical performance. Not drinking enough water can also make you feel\u00a0\nvery tired and reduce your ability to concentrate. Vitamins The basic function of these nutrients is\u00a0\nto keep away diseases and keep you healthy. Without a healthy dose of Vitamins,\u00a0\u00a0 it would be difficult for your\u00a0\nbody to fight the microorganisms. While there are about 13 types\u00a0\nof Vitamins that your body needs,\u00a0\u00a0 four of them are extremely essential. These are Vitamin A, B6, C and D. These four Vitamins play an\u00a0\nimportant role in your body. In case you aren't getting enough of these\u00a0\nVitamins, you might face some problems. For example, Lack of Vitamin B6 can cause\u00a0\nyour Blood Pressure to lower uncontrollably. Similarly, lack of other Vitamins may cause\u00a0\nskin problems, vision problems and weakness. On the other hand,\u00a0\u00a0 having enough vitamins in your body would mean\u00a0\nthat you will have a healthy immune system. The risks of getting lung or prostate cancer would\u00a0\nalso reduce with the proper intake of vitamins. Additionally, Vitamins also have high levels\u00a0\u00a0 of antioxidant properties\u00a0\nthat are good for your body. What's more? It has been found that Vitamins play an\u00a0\nimportant role in the longevity of a human being. Protein This is the nutrient that gets most of the hype. Go to any nutritionist and they will suggest a lot\u00a0\nof food items for the proper intake of protein. These include meat, eggs and some grains. So, why is protein so popular? Well, protein is the building block of your body. No, we don't mean just muscles. We are talking on a deeper level. Whether it's your bones, muscles, skin,\u00a0\u00a0 hair or even the cells of your\u00a0\nbody, everything contains protein. In fact, protein is responsible for a staggering\u00a0\n16% of the average human\u2019s body weight. Even your hormones and antibodies\u00a0\nare composed of proteins. In other words, it would be very\u00a0\ndifficult to live without this nutrient. This begs the question,\u00a0\n\"What are Proteins made of?\" Well, the answer is fairly simple, they are\u00a0\nmade up of different types of amino acids. Your body needs protein so\u00a0\nthat it can function properly. This is why your nutritionists always stress\u00a0\nthat you have a lot of protein in your diet,\u00a0\u00a0 even if you are looking to lose weight. So the next time they ask you to have\u00a0\nscrambled eggs at breakfast, take that advice. They only want what's good for you. Fats Yes, the nutrient that you want to avoid. Well, maybe you shouldn't\u00a0\navoid it so much after all. Of course, an excessive amount of fats\u00a0\nmay be very dangerous for our body. Too much fat can cause problems for\u00a0\nour blood pressure levels and heart\u00a0\u00a0 as well as our digestive and respiratory systems. So why are we saying you shouldn't avoid fats? Well according to a study\u00a0\nat Harvard Medical School,\u00a0\u00a0 it was found that fat helps in\u00a0\nthe absorption of other nutrients. On top of that, fats play an\u00a0\nimportant role in cell building. If that wasn't enough to convince you,\u00a0\u00a0 the study also showed that fats help\u00a0\nto improve your muscle movement. While you might want to avoid fat\u00a0\nbecause of the high amount of calories,\u00a0\u00a0 it would be better if you ingest\u00a0\nit and burn the calories instead. Additionally, if you can consume\u00a0\nfats at a controlled basis and burn\u00a0\u00a0 calories them it will decrease\u00a0\nthe risk of heart diseases. More importantly, you will also have\u00a0\nlower chances of getting Type 2 Diabetes. It has also been speculated that controlled\u00a0\nintake of fat improves brain function. Minerals When we talk about minerals for our body, the\u00a0\nfirst thing that might come to mind is Calcium. Although this isn't the only one. Don\u2019t forget about Iron and Zinc. So, what does the terrific trio of\u00a0\nCalcium, Iron and Zinc do for the body? Calcium is the mineral\u00a0\nresponsible for your strong bones. It also helps to transmit nerve signals\u00a0\nfrom one part of the body to another. Calcium helps to maintain\u00a0\na healthy blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as improve muscle\u00a0\ncontraction and relaxation. Similarly, Zinc is your go to mineral when\u00a0\nit comes to boosting your healing factor. Zinc improves your metabolism and\u00a0\nstrengthens your immune system. It also increases your\u00a0\nresistance against diseases. The last mineral here is Iron,\u00a0\u00a0 which is responsible for the\u00a0\ncreation of your red blood cells. On top of that, Iron also plays an important\u00a0\nrole in the production of hormones in your body. Carbohydrates While the world is moving towards a low-carb diet,\u00a0\u00a0 it still is one of the most\u00a0\nimportant nutrients for our body. Carbohydrates serve as food for your\u00a0\nbrain and your central nervous system. For your brain and your nervous system to work\u00a0\nproperly, you need a decent amount of carbs. While, we wouldn't ruin your diet\u00a0\nplan by including too many carbs. You should still consume a healthy amount of this\u00a0\nnutrient in order to have a healthy lifestyle. Are you consuming your nutrients? Do you drink enough water every day? Let us know in the comments,\u00a0\nwe would love to hear from you.",

        "Transcript": "[MUSIC PLAYING] Good day and welcome to the\nintroduction to epidemiology. My name is Dr. Kate Glyn and\nI'm the Associate Director for Science at CDC's Division\nof Scientific Education and Professional Development. This course is a basic\noverview of epidemiology. In today's session,\nwe'll define epidemiology and explain the role\nof the epidemiologist in public health. We'll learn how epidemiologists\ncharacterize public health problems and the steps\nan epidemiologist undertakes when investigating\na disease outbreak. After this session, you'll be\nable to define epidemiology, describe basic terminology\nand concepts of epidemiology, identify types of data sources\nand basic methods of data collection and interpretation,\nto describe a public health problem in terms of\ntime, place, and person, and identify the key components\nof a descriptive epidemiology outbreak investigation. Before we talk\nabout epidemiology, let's learn a bit about\nthe public health approach and how it relates to the\npublic health core sciences. Let's think about public\nhealth in a broader context. Public health\nproblems are diverse and can involve infectious\ndisease, chronic diseases, emergencies, injuries,\nenvironmental health problems, and all kinds of\nother health threats. Regardless of the\ntopic, however, we take the same general approach\nto a public health problem by following four general steps. First, we ask, what\nis the problem? In public health, we\nidentify the problem by using surveillance systems to monitor\nhealth events and behaviours occurring among a population. After we've identified\nthe problem, we next ask, what is the cause? For example, there\nare risk factors that might make certain\npopulations more susceptible to a particular\ndisease or condition, something in the environment, perhaps,\nor certain behaviors that people are practicing. After we've addressed\nwhat is the cause and identified risk\nfactors, we then ask ourselves, what intervention\nworks to address this problem? We think about\nwhat interventions have worked in the\npast and whether those are applicable to the\nparticular population that we're investigating. In the last step,\nwe ask, how can we implement the intervention? Given the resources\nwe have and what we know about the\naffected population, will this intervention\nreally work? As we go through\nthe course, you'll see different examples about\nhow this four step public health approach is applied. But to implement this\npublic health approach, practitioners use and\napply scientific methods. These methods come from\na series of core sciences that provide the foundation\nfor public health. These sciences include\npublic health surveillance, which we use to monitor a\npublic health situation. Epidemiology enables\nus to determine where diseases originate, how\nthey move through populations, and why they're\nmoving, and understand how we can prevent them. We're going to learn more about\nepidemiology in today's course. Public health laboratories\nsupport public health by allowing us to find a\ndiagnosis for a condition that we're investigating. Laboratories also\nsupport public health by conducting\nresearch and testing. As we continue to move from\npaper to electronic health records, the science of\npublic health informatics allows us to do it that the\nmost effectively possible. Informatics deals\nwith the methods of collecting, compiling,\nand effectively using electronic data to solve\npublic health problems. Prevention effectiveness\nis closely linked to public health policy. Prevention effectiveness\nstudies provide important economic\ninformation to decision makers and allow them to choose\nfrom among the options the best option possible. Public health is\nbetter able to respond by using all of the information\nthese sciences can provide. So take, for example, the public\nhealth problem of influenza. Public health\nsurveillance can monitor where and when\ncases of influenza are occurring each year. Professionals can use the\nscience of epidemiology to understand why some\npopulations choose to become vaccinated and some do not. They can use the\nscience of informatics to get clinical information\nfrom electronic health records from doctors offices\nand hospitals. Public health practitioners can\nbenefit from laboratory science because the laboratories\ncan help diagnose whether this disease\ncaused by causing fever and a cough is in fact\ninfluenza or something else. These laboratories\ncan also tell us what particular\nstrain of influenza is predominant in a given year. And they can use a\nprevention effectiveness to assess whether in fact\nan influenza vaccination campaign, that might\ncost say $200,000, might ultimately result in\na savings of over a million dollars because of savings\nin medical care costs, loss of wages, and other costs. So with this background, let's\nlearn about epidemiology, how it aligns with the\nscientific approach, and its purpose in\npublic health practice. Epidemiology is defined as\nthe study of the distribution and determinants of\nhealth related states among specified populations\nand the application of that study to the\ncontrol of health problems. The purpose of epidemiology\nin public health practice is to discover the agent, host,\nand environmental factors that affect health. To determine the\nrelative importance of causes of illness,\ndisability, and death. To identify those segments\nof the population that have the greatest risk from\nspecific causes of ill health. And to evaluate\nthe effectiveness of health programs and services\nin improving population health. To solve health\nproblems, epidemiologists use the public health\napproach that we discussed. And specifically, they do\nthis by collecting data, by conducting an assessment,\nby doing hypothesis testing, and by taking action. The boxes on the far\nright of your screen we'll go through one by\none in greater detail to show how an\nepidemiologist actually implements these steps. First, data are collected\nabout health problems occurring among the population\nthrough, as we've discussed, public health surveillance. The data collected\ninclude information about when and where the\npopulation was affected, as well as who was actually\naffected by the condition under surveillance. That is time, place, and person. This is known as\ndescriptive epidemiology and we're going to talk more\nabout that later in the course. Next, the epidemiology\nestablishes inferences on the basis of\nthese collected data and draws initial conclusions. From there, he or she\nuses the information to generate hypotheses\nabout what might be causing this public health problem. Then, the how and\nwhy of the condition is determined by\nconducting tests or studies to test\nthe hypotheses that you've developed. This determination\nof how and why is known as analytic\nepidemiology. Again, we'll cover\na little bit more about this later in the course. And finally, the\nepidemiologist takes action. In public health, this action is\noften known as an intervention. We take action to intervene\nto either prevent the disease or condition from spreading\nor continuing to occur, or to actually promote healthy\nbehaviors in a population. The epidemiologist\nrecommends implementing some form of action at\nthe population level. For example, a\ncommunity intervention. One of my earliest acts\nas an epidemiologist, was to investigate a cruise ship\noutbreak of diarrheal illness. I went in and I\nconducted data collection from all of the passengers\nand crew members on the ship by administering a\nstandard questionnaire. I asked them where they were on\nthe ship, when they became ill, if they did, and who\nthey actually were, those that became ill\nand those that didn't. Using this data, I\ngenerated a hypothesis that, in fact, the ship had\ntaken on contaminated water at one of its foreign ports. I was able to test this\nhypothesis by comparing persons who were ill with the\ndiarrheal illness, to persons who were not. I looked back and said, I notice\nthat the persons who were ill were more likely\nto have consumed tap water from the ship. Person's who did not get\nill were more likely to have consumed only bottled water. So based on this assessment,\nI made the recommendation that the ship should\nhyper chlorinate its water supply, which\nis one of the most effective treatments\nagainst the particular agent we believe was causing\nthis outbreak, Norovirus. So now, let's review\nwhat we've learned about epidemiology so far\nthrough a few knowledge check questions. Here's the first one. All of the following illustrate\nthe purpose of epidemiology except which of the following? Correct answer is C. It's\nnot a purpose of epidemiology to provide treatment for\npatients in clinical settings. Epidemiologists use a model\nfor studying infectious disease and its spread. That involves the\nmicrobe that causes the disease, the organism\nthat harbors the disease, and the external factors\nthat cause or allow disease transmission. This is also known as\nwhich of the following? The correct answer is C,\nhost, agent, and environment. So now that we know\nwhat epidemiology is, let's review some key\nterms commonly associated with the study. You'll see the terms on this\nside throughout the course. The first is\nepidemic or outbreak. This is a disease occurrence\namong a population that is in excess\nof what is expected in a given time and place. A cluster is a group of cases in\na specific time and place that might be more than expected. The third term is endemic. This describes a\ndisease or condition that's present among a\npopulation at all times. This is in contrast\nwith a pandemic, which is a disease\nor condition that's causing an epidemic\nthat actually spreads across regions. And the last term is a rate. A rate is a number\nof cases occurring during a specific period\nin a specific population. A rate is always dependent\non the size of the population during that period. So now, I'd like you to pick the\nappropriate term that matches with the following statements. Malaria is present in\nAfrica at all times because of the presence\nof infected mosquitoes. Malaria is what in Africa? The correct answer is A,\nmalaria is endemic in Africa. Number two, the Ebola\nvirus in parts of Africa, is in excess of what is\nexpected for this region. Ebola is a what in Africa? The Ebola virus is\ncurrently causing an epidemic in parts of Africa. Number three, HIV/AIDS is one\nof the worst global diseases in history. HIV/AIDS is a what? Correct? Number B, or Letter B,\nHIV/AIDS is a pandemic. And for our final one, in March\n1981, an outbreak of measles occurred among employees at\nfactory x in Fort Worth, Texas. This group of cases, in this\nspecific time and place, can be described as which of the\nterms on the top of the slide? Well done. The correct answer\nis B, cluster. So we've defined the term rate. Now, let's look a little\nbit more in depth at rates and how you actually\ncalculate them. In epidemiology, we cannot stop\nsimply at looking at the number of cases. We also need to compare rates. Rates help us compare problems\namong different populations that include two\nor more groups who differ by a selected\ncharacteristic or characteristics. For example, we\nmight compare persons who ate a certain meal\nat a certain restaurant at a certain time with\npeople who did not eat that meal at that\nrestaurant at that same time, and look for cases of\nfood borne illness. Or we might compare\nmen with women, for example, looking\nfor a risky behavior, like whether or not\nthey drive intoxicated. By comparing population\ncharacteristics, we can observe more clearly\nwhat factors might be associated with the health event. Such as, in these cases,\nwhat might have been causing the food borne illness or\nwho really is more commonly driving intoxicated. We can then determine\nwhat actions to take. Rates also help us\ndetermine unusual activity, allowing us to compare\na baseline level to a current level. So for example,\nfor influenza, we could calculate the rate\nof influenza of this year and by comparing it to\nbaseline rates in other years, determine whether this year\nthe rate is higher than usual or not. To calculate a\nrate, we first need to determine the\nfrequency of disease, which includes these three\ncomponents, the number of cases of the illness or the\ncondition we're counting, the size of the\npopulation at risk, and the period during which\nwe're calculating the rate. The formula shown on the slide\nprovides the number of cases, as a percentage of the\npopulation, for a given period. So let's say, for\nexample, that you want to find out how\ncommon it is in your city whether people don't wear seat\nbelts while they're driving. You could actually observe\na given intersection, watch all of the drivers that\npass through this intersection, and then count among\nall of those drivers the number that actually\nare not wearing seat belts. So let's say in\nthis weekend, you observed that 10 drivers did\nnot wear their seat belts and there were 100\ntotal drivers passing through that intersection. So your rate of not wearing\nseat belts would be 10 over 100, times 100, or 10%\nof the drivers. But now let's look at\nan example of how rates were calculated and\nused in an actual case of unexplained pneumonia. Members of the American\nLegion gathered for the annual American Legion Convention\nheld July 21 through 24 , 1976, in Philadelphia. Soon after the convention\nbegan, a substantial number of attendees were admitted to\nhospital emergency departments or seen it doctors offices with\nsudden onset of fever, chills, headache, malaise, dry\ncough, and muscle pain. More troublesome than that, is\nthat during July 26 to August 1, a total of 18\nconventioneers died, reportedly from pneumonia. On the morning of\nAugust 2, a nurse at a veteran's hospital\nin Philadelphia called CDC to report cases\nof severe respiratory illness among the convention attendees. Subsequent conversations\nthat same day with public health officials\nuncovered an additional 71 cases among persons who'd\nattended the conference. The goal of the\ninvestigation was to find out why these\nconventioneers were becoming ill and in some cases, dying. These cases of\nunexplained pneumonia were investigated\nand subsequently given the name Legionnaires\nDisease because of their association\nwith attendance at the American Legion\nConvention in July of 1976. CDC investigators focused\non a particular hotel as the possible\nsource of the outbreak because it was a common\nfactor among persons who actually were ill with this\nunusual pneumonia-like illness. The investigators\nwanted to find out if any trends\nexisted by age group among hotel guests\nwho became ill. So they looked at the\ndifferent age groups and that's shown in\nthe rows of this table. In the first column, you\nhave the disease frequency, or the number of conventioneers\nthat became sick, by age group. In the second column,\nyou have the unit size of the population, or the\ntotal number of conventioneers, in each age group. And the third\nelement is indicated by the arrow, the time period\nthat you are looking at to calculate this rate. So we can calculate the\nrate using the formula that we've already discussed\nfor looking at each age group and the rate at which\nthey became ill after staying at, or attending a meeting, at\nhotel A during the convention. And the rates themselves\nare shown in the column to the far right. So looking at this\ntable, which age group had the largest number of\nconventioneers that became ill? It's actually the age\ngroup of 50 through 59, who had 27 persons who became ill. But you'll notice\nthat this is also the largest proportion of all\nof the convention attendees. So now I'll ask you, which\ngroup had the highest rate of persons becoming ill? So the highest rate is actually\namong those individuals 70 years or older, and\nthis is why epidemiologists not only look at the raw numbers\nbut also must look at the rate, or they might actually be\nslightly misled by their data. So let's pause for\na knowledge check. On day one of a technology\nconference in San Diego, 15 presenters who were\nsetting up for their sessions in annex x, became ill\nwith flu like symptoms. During the course\nof the conference, 20 participants who attended\nsessions, also in annex x, became ill with\nthe same symptoms. To begin calculating the\nrate of this outbreak, investigators should\nfirst determine which of the following? The correct answer is B, the\nnumber of cases of illness. So we're going to come back\nto this Legionnaires Disease investigation a\nlittle later, but what I'd like to talk about\nnow are approaches to epidemiology\nstudies, specifically, experimental and\nobservational epidemiology. In an experimental\nstudy, the investigators can control certain\nfactors within the study from the beginning. An example of this kind of study\nis a vaccine efficacy trial that might be conducted by\ninvestigators from the National Institutes of Health. They could take a group\nof study participants and administer to\nsome, randomly, a new experimental\nvaccine, and the balance would receive the\nstandard routine vaccine that's already being given. The investigators would\nobserve the outcome of this study, looking\nat whether the health event that the vaccine is\nprotecting against actually occurs or not, and\ntake the decision about which vaccine\nshould ultimately be implemented more widely. In an observational study,\nin contrast, the epidemiology does not control\nthe circumstances but can only observe\nwhat is happening or what has already happened. Observational studies\ncan be further subdivided into descriptive and\nanalytic studies. Descriptive epidemiology is the\nmore basic of these categories and the stalwart of\nepidemiology practice. In a descriptive study,\nthe epidemiologist collects information to\ncharacterize and summarise the public health\nevent or problem. In the analytic study,\nthe epidemiologist relies on comparisons\nbetween groups to determine the role of\nspecific causative conditions or risk factors. So hopefully, you're already\nlearning that time, place, and person is the mantra\nof the epidemiologist. So another way of comparing\ndescriptive and analytic epidemiology is to say that\nduring the descriptive process, we're concerned with when\nthe population was affected, where the population\nwas affected, and who was actually affected. From these observations,\nthe epidemiologists can generate a hypothesis about\nwhy things really happened. And then to test\nthat hypothesis, epidemiologists must\nuse an analytic process in which they ask how and why\nthe population was affected. So let's look at an example. In 1982, an epidemiologist\nin the Georgia Department of Public Health\nbecame interested in the number of deaths\nassociated with farm tractors. He determined he could\nactually examine this issue by using information that\nhad already been collected, by using death certificates\nthat were part of a previously existing surveillance system. So he obtained the\ndeath certificates for all of the deaths\nfrom 1971 through 1981 that were associated with\nfarm tractor incidents. After collecting the data,\nhe described the problem and then actually\nused the information to generate hypotheses. Now, we'll talk\nabout the hypotheses in a second but let's\nfirst look at how he described the problem. This graph describes the\nwhen for 166 of the farm tractor associated deaths. Let's examine the data by\nlooking at the time of day when the deaths occurred. What inferences can we\nmake from this graph? Well, you can see that\nthere are two real peaks in the number of deaths. One is happening\nbetween 11 and 12, right before lunch, and\nthe second, the highest peak, between 4:00 and 5:00\nPM, towards the end of the day. Also when children\nmight be home. In addition, you can see\nthat one of the lowest events is between these two\npeaks, between the hours of 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. So looking at these\ndata, you might infer that increased\nnumber of deaths occur when farmers are\nmore tired, perhaps right before lunch or right\nat the end of the day, and that in fact, fewer\ndeaths happen between 12 and 1 because people are\neating lunch and less likely to be out on tractors and\npotentially hurting themselves. Also, you might think\nabout that later peak as when children\nare home from school and maybe somehow children might\nbe contributing to the fact that these events are happening. So this graph describes the who. It indicates the number\nof deaths by age group. What else can you actually\ninfer from this graph? It's clear that\nthere's an increase in the number of deaths\namong older persons, which again is part of the\ndescriptive analysis. So let me ask you, by\nreviewing these data, which age group is at greatest risk for\ndeath from tractor related incidents among this population? In fact, you cannot tell that\nfrom this graph because this only has raw data, not rates. So maybe, in fact, there\nare more tractor drivers among the 60 through\n69-year-old age category and that's why\nthere's more deaths. Conversely, maybe it's\nbecause older tractor drivers are more likely to be associated\nwith dangerous tractor events, or more likely to die\nif they get injured. But you don't really\nknow because you don't know the population who's\nactually driving the tractors. And what about these children? The deaths occurring in\nzero to nine years of age? What can you say about them? Well, you could\nhypothesize that when they come home from school maybe\nthey take over on the tractors. Maybe they play and are more\nlikely to cause accidents. But again, you can't actually\nanswer these questions. But these data are valuable\nfor generating hypotheses for further investigation. And this map describes\nthe where of the tractor associated deaths, with\nthe numbers showing the number of deaths\nand where they occurred in the state of Georgia. You can see that more\ndeaths are actually occurring in northern Georgia. In fact, this part of\nGeorgia is more mountainous and has more rugged terrain. Fewer deaths are happening in\nsouthern and central Georgia, where the land is\nactually flatter. So again, these\ndata can't tell you why the accidents are happening,\nbut you could hypothesize. Perhaps it's more dangerous\nto drive a tractor in the more rugged terrain\nof northern Georgia. Or perhaps there\nare fewer deaths in the south because\nthere's more tractor driving and the drivers are more\nexperienced at driving their tractors, so less\nlikely to get into an accident and die. So these are the\nkinds of hypotheses that this investigator\nwould have gone on then to further try and\ntest in his analytic process. So time for another\nknowledge check. Choose the correct answer from\nthese following three choices. An epidemiologist\nis doing a study on the sleep patterns\nof college students but does not provide\nany intervention. What type of study is this? The correct answer is C, this\nis an observational study. A study of heart disease\ncomparing a group who eats healthy foods\nand exercises regularly with one who does not, in an\neffort to test association. What kind of study is this? This is B, an analytic study. And number two, a study to\ndescribe the eating habits of adolescents, aged 13 to\n18 years, in community x, is what kind of study? This is A, a descriptive study. So we've covered definitions,\nkey terms, and approaches to epidemiology. Let's turn now to the\nsources epidemiologists use, the methods they\nuse to collect data, and the three common\ntypes of study designs. Where do all of the data come\nfrom that epidemiologists use? And how are they collected? Here are some\nmethods and examples for each of the main\nsources of data. But please note that this\nlist is far from exhaustive. We often collect\ndata from individuals by using questionnaires\nand surveys, for example. Environmental data are collected\nin multiple different ways. For example, an epidemiologist\nmight collect samples from a river to test for the\npresence of certain toxins. Health care providers collect\nconsiderable amounts of data and record these in\nclinical records, which can be used by an epidemiologist. And data from non-health\nrelated sources, such as financial\nand legal records, can also be gathered\nand reviewed. Looking at sales, court\nproceedings, arrests, and so on. Examples of non-health\nrelated sources that can provide key\ndata to public health include information\non cigarette sales, or records of intoxicated\ndriver arrests. After data are collected,\nas we've mentioned, hypotheses are tested,\ntrends are evaluated, and factors between or\namong groups are compared. By conducting different\nstudies, epidemiologists are attempting in\ndifferent ways to discover if a causal association exists\nbetween an exposure, or risk factor, and a health condition\nby making comparisons of factors between groups. To test hypotheses, three study\ndesigns are commonly used. These are cross-sectional,\ncohort, and case control. The first of these, a\ncross-sectional study, is similar to a\nsurvey in that it provides a snapshot of the\npopulation at a point in time. Using this study, epidemiologist\ndefines the target population, then collects data from\nthe population or a subset of the population, at one\nspecific point in time, and participants are included\nregardless of their exposure or disease status. An example would be to\nconduct a random telephone survey at a university and\nask a subset of students how frequently they'd\nexercised in the last week, and whether they were\nconsidered overweight, normal weight, or obese. You could get an idea\nof exercise habits, and the prevalence of obesity\namong this population, but you also need to consider\nwhen you take that survey. For example, was the previous\nweek you were asking about, was that finals week? Was that spring break? You really have to\nthink that this is just a single snapshot in time and\nthat selection of that time is really important. In the cohort study,\nthe epidemiologist selects a population,\nthen categorizes everyone in that population by\nwhether he or she was exposed to one or more\nrisk factors of interest. Participants are\nfollowed over time to determine whether\na particular health outcome actually develops. So here's an example\nof a cohort study. Let's say you want to\nfind out whether taking a optional healthy eating\ncourse at a high school has an impact on the food\nchoices that students make, and maybe even on their outcome,\nsuch as obesity or diabetes. A cohort study could follow\na class, an the entire year of students, and you'd\nseparate those students into those who opted to take\nthe healthy eating course and those that did not. You then follow those students\nover the following year and observe how their eating\npatterns actually play out. And in fact, maybe even issues\nrelated to obesity or diabetes. So this is an example\nof a cohort study. And finally, the third study\ntype is the case control study. This kind of study\ncompares one group who has a disease or condition\nwith another group who does not. The first group,\nthe ill persons, we refer to as case patients. Those without the conditions,\nwe refer to as control subjects. The epidemiologist,\nin this kind of study, then works backwards\nfrom those who had illness who\ndidn't looking back to see if they had exposure\nto certain risk factors or practiced certain\nkinds of health behaviors. So for this example,\nlet me go back to the cruise ship investigation\nthat I discussed earlier. I conducted a case\ncontrol study and I looked at people who had the\ndiarrheal illness and those who did not. And I then looked\nback and looked at their exposure, whether\nthey consumed the tap water or whether they consumed\nonly bottled water. So let's check what you've\nlearned during this section. Which of the\nfollowing are examples of a health related\nsource of data collection? The correct answers are B and\nC. Intoxicated drivers arrests, and medical board actions\nagainst the physicians, are non-health related\nsources of data collection. Examine the terms on the\nslide and match each study with correct case definition. Study one, subjects\nwith diabetes are compared with\nsubjects without diabetes. This is C, a case control study. A study of women,\naged 50 to 60 years, in a community located close\nto a nuclear power facility, is what kind of study? This is A, a\ncross-sectional study. And finally, subjects who have\nreceived nutritional counseling and who have\nexercised twice a week are compared with\nsubjects who have not. What kind of study is this? This is a cohort study. So for the last\nportion of the course, we're going to review the steps\nto investigate an outbreak. Epidemiologists do not\npractice their craft in a vacuum or only\nsitting at a desk. In fact, epidemiologist are\nout in the field every day applying and putting\ntheir expertise to use. A classic way that\nepidemiologists apply their knowledge, is by\nusing the 10 steps involved in investigating an outbreak. These steps include establishing\nthe existence of an outbreak, preparing for field work,\nverifying the diagnosis, defining and identifying cases,\nusing descriptive epidemiology, developing, evaluating,\nand then refining hypotheses, implementing\ncontrol and prevention measures, and finally,\ncommunicating findings. Now, only in theory, in\nfact, do these activities of investigation roll out in\nthis nice, coherent order. In fact, it's often\nmore fluid and you need to be more flexible\nbased on the actual situation at hand. Now, let's go through\nthese 10 steps, going back to our Legionnaires\nDisease investigation that we discussed earlier. So as a reminder, after such a\nsubstantial number of American Legion conference attendees,\nwith similar symptoms, were admitted to hospital\nemergency departments, or examined in doctors' offices,\nan initial investigation began. During step one,\nepidemiologists were able to establish the existence\nof the Legionnaires Disease outbreak by reviewing records\nand data from multiple sources that confirmed the\ndisease cases were indeed higher than normal from the\nprevious weeks or months. Step two involved\npreparing for field work by researching the\noutbreak, gathering supplies and equipment,\nand preparing to travel. The epidemiologist also\nconsulted with other entities. For example, health care\nproviders, and members of the local health\ndepartment that they would be collaborating\nwith on this investigation, and finding out who\nthey should touch bases with when they arrived. During step three,\nthe epidemiologists ensured that the\nproblem was accurately diagnosed by speaking\nwith patients and by reviewing laboratory\nfindings and clinical test results. After the diagnosis\nwas confirmed, a standard set of criteria,\nalso known as a case definition, was established as step\nfour of the investigation. To determine whether a\nperson should be categorized as having the specific illness\nthey were investigating, or something else. Four components are\ntypically included in a case investigation-- uh,\nexcuse me, in a case definition, including,\none, clinical information about the disease. What signs and symptoms\nhave been observed? The second component\nare characteristics about the persons\nwho are affected. Do you see any\ncommonalities among those who have become ill? The third, is information\nabout the location or place. Where are the affected\npersons locating? Or where have they been? The fourth aspect are\nspecifications of time during which the\nillness onset occurred. What date or time did\npersons first become ill? And what was the\nduration of the symptoms? During the outbreak, a case\ndefinition typically evolves. Often, in the beginning,\nit's pretty broad to try and make sure you're\nfinding all possible cases. But as you get more information,\nthe case definition generally gets more specific to be able\nto accurately identify cases that are part of your outbreak. In this instance, to\nassist epidemiologists in identifying early\nLegionnaires Disease cases, public health nurses made rounds\nof local Philadelphia hospitals to gather data about\nthose who became ill and to verify the\ndiagnosis according to the case definition. Meanwhile, laboratory samples\nand clinical examinations were tested and\nreviewed, respectively. After the initial case\ndefinition was established, health care facilities,\nsuch as doctor's offices, clinical laboratories,\nand hospitals, were contacted to request that\nany observations of illness matching the case definition\nbe reported to public health authorities. Step five used\ndescriptive epidemiology to describe the\nLegionnaires Disease and orient the data by\nidentifying what, who, where, and when. After these were identified,\nthe epidemiologist proceeded to study the dates,\ntimes, places, and persons, hopefully those words are\nsounding familiar to you, and ultimately develop\ntheir hypotheses about how and why people had become ill. This graph indicates the number\nof Legionnaires Disease cases among conventioneers\nand non-conventioneers by day in July and\nAugust of 1976. Now remember, these\nare the absolute number of cases, not the disease rate. You can see that the number\nof cases peaks from July 25 through July 27,\nindicated by the arrow, soon after the\nconvention begins, which is indicated\nby the bracket on the bottom of the slide. By the end of the convention,\nthe number of cases had reached its peak and\nthen subsequently started to decline. However, this\ndescriptive analysis only tells us what\ncan be read directly from this graph and data. And analytic processes\ntake us one step further in testing any hypothesis\nwe would generate. You'll remember\nfrom the discussion before that the investigation\nsuggested that the illness was somehow associated with\nhotel A. This table lists the rates of illnesses among\nAmerican Legion delegates by age and where\nthey were staying, hotel A or other hotels. So let's see what\nthe data tell us. The rows, again, indicate\ndata specific by age group for the conventioneers. The first three columns\nshow the data for hotel A. The number of ill persons, the\ntotal number of conventioneers, and the calculated percent ill. We know from before that\nthe highest percentage of ill persons was those\nage 70 or older in hotel A, and this is somewhat,\nalthough not 100%, true for the other\nhotels as well. But by combining the information\nfrom all of the age groups, those who stayed in hotel A\nhave the highest percentage of illness. 9% in hotel A versus 5.4%\nand 6.8% at the other hotels. So we can infer, therefore,\nthat a connection exists between staying in\nhotel A and becoming ill. We can also infer that older\npersons may somehow be more susceptible to the disease. During steps six,\nseven, and eight, focused hypotheses,\nthat is theories that could be\ntested for validity, about Legionnaires\nDisease were developed regarding how and why\nthe outbreak occurred. They were then evaluated for\nvalidity and refined as needed. One hypothesis stated that\nthe illness was associated with convention attendees\nwho were guests at or who had visited\nthe particular hotel during their time\nat the convention. Epidemiologists on\nthis investigation tested this hypothesis\nin a series of ways. They conducted a randomized\ntelephone survey of guests registered at four hotels\nin the area from July 6 through August 7,\nincluding hotels where the conventioneers\nhad stayed and those where\nthey'd not stayed. They reviewed hotel\ndata by interviewing hotel employees who'd become\nill during the convention. They reviewed hospital emergency\ndepartment admissions data and collected\nenvironmental samples from selected\nlocations in hotel A. They reviewed\nweather data to look for any correlation between\nspecific weather events and the onset of illness. They interviewed hotel\nguests and workers about places they visited,\npeople they met with, and foods they'd eaten\nduring the convention. And ultimately, they conducted\ntwo case control studies. Although the\ninvestigation suggested that exposure in the\noutbreak apparently occurred over several\ndays, investigation results were actually initially unclear. Researchers were unable to\nlocate the bacteria that caused Legionnaires\nDisease because of the historic difficulty of\ngrowing bacteria like these in laboratory conditions. Five months after the\noutbreak investigation of these cases of\nLegionnaires Disease occurred, results finally indicated\nthat spending time in the lobby of hotel A was\nthe risk factor for illness. In December of 1976, a CDC\nlaboratorian successfully located the source\nbacteria after continuing to test specimens that were\nactually thought to be dead. A new bacteria that\nhad caused the disease was discovered in this process. After isolating the\nbacteria, conditions at hotel were investigated to\ndetermine their connection with the onset of the illness. Bacteria similar to this one\ngrow in warm waters in nature, such as hot springs,\nand also had been associated with air\nconditioning cooling systems. So investigators\nconcluded that those who had become ill\nin Philadelphia had inhaled air from the\nair conditioning unit at hotel A either at\nguests or by walking past the lobby on the\nsidewalk outside the hotel. They also noted that hotel\nworkers had not become ill and they believe that this\nwas because they actually had built up an\nimmunity over time to this particular bacteria,\nwhich explained why the outbreak didn't\nseem to affect them as much as the conventioneers. After the cause of the\noutbreak was identified, investigators moved\non to step nine. To minimize the growth\nof the bacteria that causes Legionnaires\nDisease, controls were implemented,\nsuch as chlorination of water and testing of\nindustrial air cooling systems. During step 10,\ninvestigation findings were communicated to a variety\naudiences, local health authorities, the medical\ncommunity, the general public, and lawmakers and other leaders. Usually, the findings are\nreported in an oral briefing to health authorities and those\nresponsible for implementing control and prevention measures. During the briefing,\nepidemiologists describe what they did and how\nthey did it, what they learned, and what they recommend should\nbe done about the illness. The findings are also written\nup in reports that generally contain an introduction, a\nbackground, methods, results, the discussion, and\nfinally, recommendations. And these reports serve\nnot only as a record of the investigation but also as\na tool for future investigators and as a contribution to the\nscientific knowledge base. So let's answer a few\nknowledge check questions that are based on what you've\nlearned about Legionnaires Disease and the 10 steps\ninvolved in an outbreak investigation. In 1976, during an\nAmerican Legion Convention, 11 attendees had died of\napparent heart attacks by August 1. Dr. Campbell contacted the\nPennsylvania Department of Health after realizing\nthat he had treated three of those 11 attendees. What is the first step that\nthe Pennsylvania Department of Health should have followed? The first step would\nbe to establish the existence of an outbreak. CDC then launched\nan investigation. However, no effective\ncommunication existed between\nscientists in the field interviewing patients and\nthose in the laboratory who were testing specimens. As a first step in\nstopping this outbreak, what should the team have\ndone to identify persons who were part of the outbreak? The correct answer is B,\nestablish a case definition to identify cases. In speculating that the\ncooling system might be the source of the\noutbreak, what step was the epidemiologist\nimplementing? That was the process of A,\ndeveloping a hypothesis. In January 1977, the\nLegionella bacterium was finally identified\nand isolated, and was found to be\nbreeding in the cooling tower of the hotel's\nair conditioning system. The bacteria then spread\nthrough the building whenever the system was engaged. Which answer below best\ndescribe what the investigation team should do regarding\ntheir original hypothesis? The correct answer is\nD, they should both A, evaluate it and B, refine it. The finding from this\noutbreak investigation led to the development\nof new regulations worldwide for climate\ncontrol systems. What step does this illustrate? This is B, implementing control\nand prevention measures. Before we wrap up\nthe course, let's review what we've learned today. During this course, you\nlearned to define epidemiology, to describe basic terminology\nand concepts of epidemiology, to identify types\nof data sources, and basic methods of data\ncollection and interpretation. You learned to describe\na public health problem in terms of time, place,\nand person, and to identify the key components of a\ndescriptive epidemiology outbreak investigation.

        "Transcript": "are you confused by the various Healthcare Systems in your country and around the world you're not alone this is the anatomy of healthcare Dr jbal med school insiders.com perhaps you think healthcare is broken and like many of us you want change but we must first understand Healthcare before trying to fix it in this three-part series we'll explore the major Healthcare models of the world how the US fares in comparison and what changes to make moving forward anytime you think about Healthcare whether abroad or here in the US this is the blueprint that should come to your mind at the root level Healthcare Systems come down to to four constituents the government the insurers the patients and the providers which includes doctors Healthcare professionals and hospitals depending on the healthare system in consideration the interaction and dynamic between these constituents vary for example sometimes the government is the insurer which means it takes on the financial responsibility other times the government is completely out of the picture or it may play a regulatory role there are four factors to consider between the four major Healthcare models the first factor is the number of sources of coverage or financial support that exist under the model if there is one source of coverage we call it a single-payer model and if there are several sources of coverage we call it a multi-payer model the second factor is the source of coverage itself this could be the government in single-payer models or private insurance companies in multi-payer models the third factor is the source of funding how are the government and insurance companies getting money to provide coverage the last factor in consideration is the sector responsible for delivering care the private sector or the public sector this has to do with whether the hospitals are government-owned or privately owned and whether the doctors are govern government employed or privately employed this has major implications for the government's regulatory power autonomy of providers and Innovation each of the four major Healthcare models sits on different points of the nationalization privatization Spectrum with one end representing 100% nationalization in which the government fully funds and delivers care and the other end representing 100% privatization in which the private sector fully funds and delivers care with no input from the government broadly speaking nationalization is associated with greater accessibility to care lower costs and reduced administrative complexity whereas privatization is associated with less regulation greater freedom for Physicians and a more fertile ground for Innovation out of the four Global Healthcare models there are two Single Payer models one private payer model and one multi-payer model the two Single Payer models are the beverage model found in Britain and the national health insurance model found in Canada in both of these models the government funds Healthcare but the primary difference between these models is in the delivery of care in the beverage model there is public delivery of care which means that the Physicians hospitals and clinics are all government-owned or part of the public sector in the national health insurance model there is private delivery of care which means that hospitals clinics and Physicians are all part of the private sector and have greater freedom to practice as they please without government input there is often an expectation that greater government involvement translates to increased bureaucratic complexity but that isn't necessarily true in a single-payer system there is no Market competition and with the government financing care the costs that providers charge are kept low benefits are standardized and with no Financial motives to deny claims and no concern for profit the delivery of care is cheaper and often simpler to navigate the frustrating complexity of insurance plans claims processing and claims disputing factors that drive administrative expenses through the roof under the US Healthcare System are absent from the picture entirely more on this in the next few videos in both of these single-payer systems there is universal coverage which means that every citizen is financially backed by an insur with little out-of-pocket cost to the citizen the beverage model is often criticized for its potential risk of overutilization as policy makers fear that free access would drive patients to demand unnecessary Services resulting in higher costs and taxes that said these systems have regulations and proactive prevention campaigns to circumvent these issues to put this all into perspective let's say your friend Harry a British citizen gets into a crazy car accident and Britain he'll be rushed to the hospital government owned he'll be treated by physicians government employed and he'll also walk out without any bill because the government pays this is Public Funding and public delivery on the other hand let's say your friend Justin gets into a crazy car accident in Canada there under the national health insurance model he'll receive Care at a privately owned hospital and all his follow-up visits will take place with Physicians of his choice in the private sector even though the government is footing the bill it does not control how Healthcare is delivered by the doctors nor does it mandate its citizens to visit select providers the doctors have greater freedom to practice and generally patients also have greater freedom to choose their providers the third model is the out-of-pocket model this model is essentially the absence of any formalized Healthcare System and we coin it a private payer model instead of a Single Payer pay or multipay model because citizens are forced to pay for care directly out of their pockets with no external coverage most nations are too poor to systematically provide Mass Medical Care folks in such countries scramble to pay unaffordable bills in the face of emergencies Medical Care is a luxury reserved for the wealthy the fourth and final model is the bismar model which the German Healthcare System is derived from this model is the most privatized of the four models with the government having the least involvement at a surface level it may resemble the US healthcare system because insurance is linked to one's employment just as as it is for most working Americans the source of coverage is private insurance companies and citizens dedicate a portion of their payroll tax to remain insured with the delivery of care being mostly private the theoretical Bismark model is meant to provide Universal coverage but a criticism of the system is that even though Universal coverage is the intent it fails to financially cover those who are transitioning between jobs or are unemployed and it's starkly different from the US for reasons we will visit soon the final point to consider is the source of coverage for each of these Healthcare models funding for the beverage a national health insurance model comes from income taxes the government collects a tax from its citizens that ultimately enable government-based funding to support healthcare costs in the bismar model funding comes from a payroll deduction employers take a portion of their employees salary and put it towards paying a premium to keep their employees enrolled under the health insurance plan note that Universal coverage is an intended feature of all three of these models and it can in fact be achieved in systems that are not single paay of models despite what you may hear from policy makers in fact most countries with universal health insurance programs rely on multi-payer systems most of these countries use a hybrid of these four models implemented uniformly across the nation's borders the United States is fundamentally different and more complicated the major difference between other nations and the United States is the fact that here in the US the healthcare system is a hodgepodge of systems the US is one of few countries that provide care non-uniformly in four different ways depending on the patient population in consideration those four populations are veterans citizens aged 65 or older uninsured citizens and working citizens with employer sponsored health insurance in the past the term socialized medicine ignited fears of the us moving towards becoming a communist or socialist state today the term ignites an expectation for poor medical outcomes horrendous waiting lines excessive Taxation and the erosion of free private Enterprise while the concept of socialized medicine makes some Americans uncomfortable the reality is that a major portion of our healthc care system functions analogously to the British system which is regarded as the closest example of socialized medicine in the world we do this through the veterans Health Administration the VHA is a government funded and government managed vehicle that treats veterans at government-owned hospitals under the service of government employed doctors US citizens over the age of 65 receive care in a national health insurance model- like fashion as found in Canada manifesting in the form of Medicare the government pays for the health care cost of the elderly people under 65 with certain disabilities and people of all ages with endstage renal disease Medicare is financed through tax revenue a 2.9% dedicated payroll tax split evenly between employer years and employees and monthly beneficiary premiums Medicare funds 70% of healthcare spending by the elderly with the other 30% accounted for by out of pocket spending or supplementary private insurance the key takeaway is that for this patient population the government is publicly financing the cost of care but the delivery of care remains in the hands of the private sector just as in Canada the third patient population is the uninsured with 30 million Americans uninsured our nation happens to be the only developed country that lacks a system of Universal Health Coverage the unfortunate reality is that medical e strike when least expected and in such scenarios many Americans are forced to potentially face Financial ruin in their effort to seek care expanding coverage remains one of our biggest Healthcare challenges but the politicization of care and the doctrine of American exceptionalism often prevents any meaningful conversation about Healthcare reform from taking place veterans citizens aged 65 and older and the uninsured represent only a portion of the US population for most US citizens health insurance is provided in a Bismark like fashion with insurance linked to one's employment status in a manner that is similar to the system in Germany again the tenant of the bismar model is that employers and employees fund Their Own Private health insurance through sickness funds financed by payroll deductions the primary criticism of both the Bismark model and the variant used in the United States is that coverage isn't necessarily granted to those who are between jobs or unable to work for years people have been asking whether it makes sense for health insurance to be linked to one's job the pandemic has laid clear that in precise moments where friends and families and neighbors are most in need of care they may also be least likely to have have a job and by extension access to the very care they need however this variant is starkly different from the theoretical Bismark model under the theoretical model insurance companies are required to be nonprofit and every citizen is supposed to be covered this is not the case in the United States where our insurance companies have a history of marginalizing those with pre-existing conditions from being covered and are profit driven as our hospitals and providers Bill insurers seeking reimbursement for services insurers fiercely push back denying claims this insur provider battle drives billing related administrative expenses soaring through the roof revisiting the nationalization privatization Spectrum as we move from left to right we see the beverage model implemented in Britain followed by the national health insurance model implemented in Canada and the bismar model found in Germany farthest to the right lies the United States healthcare system which is the most privatized and Market driven a feature that cultivates the nation's fertile ground for Innovation each of these Healthcare models has its own unique basket of pros and cons generally those that are more privatized are driving Innovation and enjoying greater autonomy and those that are more government regulated have a simpler delivery of care less administrative complexity and a population with greater accessibility to care join us in part two of the series to explore which country has the best Healthcare System much love

        "Transcript": "Alternative medicine for depression that's what\u00a0\nI'm going to talk about today. I'm Dr. Tracey Marks\u00a0 a psychiatrist and an on this channel I talk about\u00a0\nmental health education and self-improvement. \u00a0 I publish videos every week so if you don't want\u00a0\nto miss one press the subscribe button. We have\u00a0\u00a0 many prescription options to treat depression\u00a0\ntoday but there are people who don't believe\u00a0\u00a0 in taking prescription medications.  I ain't taking\u00a0nobody's medication.  But they may be ok with taking\u00a0\u00a0 something over the counter. Now keep in mind\u00a0\nthat just because it's derived naturally does\u00a0\u00a0 not mean that it's not a drug. Really anything\u00a0\nthat has  \u00a0 a chemical effect on your body is a\u00a0drug. Nevertheless here are eight drugs that are\u00a0known \n\u00a0\u00a0 to be used for depression. Number one: 5-HTP 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin. This means\u00a0\nthat it's part of the chemical pathway to make\u00a0\u00a0 serotonin. So it's serotonin like.  There's been\u00a0\nabout 30 clinical trials showing some promising\u00a0\u00a0 results with 5HTP, but here's the downside. It has\u00a0\na really short half-life which requires you to\u00a0\u00a0 take it three to four times a day. So if you've\u00a0\nnever taken a medication before it's hard enough\u00a0\u00a0 to remember to take something once a day much\u00a0\nless three or four times a day. The common side\u00a0\u00a0 effect is wicked nausea and maybe even vomiting.\u00a0\nNumber two: Inositol. Inositol is abundant\u00a0\u00a0 in the brain and chemically it's a sugar alcohol. And it's a building block for other chemicals in\u00a0\u00a0the body. We don't really know exactly how it helps\u00a0\ndepression and there haven't been a lot of studies\u00a0\u00a0 showing effectiveness. In the few studies that I've\u00a0\nseen though it was used as an add-on treatment so\u00a0\u00a0 you would take it in addition to something that\u00a0\nyou were already taking for depression. The main\u00a0\u00a0 side effects of it are gas and mania.  Number 3: L-Methylfolate Folate is vitamin B9, which is an essential vitamin of the body. And usually when\u00a0you hear the term or the word essential it just\u00a0\u00a0 means that your body doesn't make and the only way\u00a0\nyou can get it is through your diet or supplements.\u00a0\u00a0 And while I'm talking about this, folate is the\u00a0\nnaturally occurring nutrient that you get from\u00a0\u00a0 green leafy vegetables, egg yolks etc.  Folic acid\u00a0\nis a synthetic dietary supplement. Neither Folate\u00a0 nor folic acid are biologically active in the body.\u00a0\nYour body has to do something to it first. So once\u00a0\u00a0 your body metabolizes either the folate or folic\u00a0\nacid the active form is called L-methylfolate.\u00a0\u00a0 So that's where L-methylfolate comes from. \u00a0\nL-methylfolate is a building block for serotonin\u00a0,\u00a0 norepinephrine, and dopamine and these are all\u00a0\nchemicals involved in mood. Studies have shown\u00a0\u00a0 that people with low folate levels in the body\u00a0\ntend to have a more severe depression and they\u00a0\u00a0 don't respond as well to antidepressants. So in\u00a0\npractice, L-methylfolate is best used also as\u00a0\u00a0 an add-on treatment to your antidepressant\u00a0.\nI don't really think it will do much if you\u00a0\u00a0 just use it alone. You can get a prescription\u00a0\nfor L-methylfolate from your doctor and it's\u00a0\u00a0 technically considered a biological food but it\u00a0\nstill requires a prescription and many insurances\u00a0\u00a0 are now paying for it. But if yours doesn't, it\u00a0\ncan cost upwards of a hundred dollars. So folic\u00a0\u00a0 acid can be a good option and cheaper substitute\u00a0\nfor that, it's just that your body will have to\u00a0\u00a0 process it into the L-methylfolate. Next is\u00a0\nSaffron Stigna. Yes, this is the same yellow\u00a0\u00a0 spice that's use to season rice. There's been\u00a0\na limited number of studies, but enough to show\u00a0\u00a0 some positive results. The recommended dose is 15\u00a0\nmilligrams twice a day so here again you have the\u00a0\u00a0 inconvenience of needing to take it twice. When\u00a0\na medication is recommended for more than once\u00a0\u00a0 a day usually it's not as effective or maybe\u00a0\nnot even effective at all if you only take it\u00a0\u00a0 once a day. So if you are going take something like\u00a0\nthis where it's required multiple times a day, you\u00a0\u00a0 really do need to take it multiple times a day\u00a0\nto get the desired effect. Saffron is expensive\u00a0\u00a0 and you should definitely consult your doctor\u00a0\nif you're considering taking it and you're on\u00a0\u00a0 blood thinning medications. Next is Sam-E.\nSam-E stands for s-adenosylmethionine you never want\u00a0\u00a0 to need to say that. It enhances serotonin and\u00a0\nnorepinephrine. The studies show effectiveness\u00a0\u00a0 in treating mild to moderate depression, however\u00a0\nmany of the studies use small sample sizes and\u00a0\u00a0 different forms of the drug like the injectable\u00a0\nform, like who's gonna actually do that... so that's\u00a0\u00a0 kind of the the downside of the studies. But the\u00a0\nrecommended dose is 200 to 800 milligrams twice\u00a0\u00a0 a day. As far as side effects you can get some\u00a0\nnausea with Sam-E and you should also avoid it\u00a0\u00a0 if you have bipolar disorder as it can worsen your\u00a0\nmania. St. John's Wort. St. John's Wort is an herb\u00a0\u00a0 and it comes the closest to the antidepressants\u00a0\nas far as effectiveness. It's been shown to help\u00a0\u00a0 mild depression as a single agent so all of these\u00a0\nothers that I've talked about well maybe not \u00a0 not Sam-E. Sam-E has been used alone as well.\u00a0\nThe others you kind of need to take it with\u00a0\u00a0 something. St. John's wort is another one that has\u00a0\nbeen studied as a standalone agent. It's not as\u00a0\u00a0 good though for moderate to severe depression. The\u00a0\nrecommended dose is 300 milligrams three times a\u00a0\u00a0 day. And it can interfere with the metabolism\u00a0\nof other medications. So if you're taking another\u00a0\u00a0 prescription medication, you need to tell your\u00a0\ndoctor that about the St. John's Wort so he or\u00a0\u00a0 she can determine whether or not it's going to\u00a0\ninterfere with any of your other medications.\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, there's omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin\u00a0\nD. And omega-3 fatty acids fight inflammation\u00a0\u00a0 in the body. And depression is thought to have a\u00a0\ninflammatory component to it you can check out\u00a0\u00a0 a video I did on omega-3 fatty acids if you want\u00a0\nto know more about Omega 3's. For depression the\u00a0\u00a0 recommended dose is one to two grams of EPA plus\u00a0\nDHA and it's better actually if there's more EPA\u00a0\u00a0 than DHA. it won't work alone and it's meant\u00a0\nto take as a supplement. Most of the vitamin\u00a0D in your body is made in your skin from sun\u00a0\nexposure. You can get some from your diet, but\u00a0\u00a0 it's mostly from sun exposure. Many people are\u00a0\nvitamin D deficient and don't know it. Vitamin\u00a0D supplementation has been shown to improve\u00a0\ndepression in people on medication and who are\u00a0\u00a0 vitamin D deficient. It was not that helpful for\u00a0\ndepressed people who were not already deficient.\u00a0\u00a0 So just like omega-3, Vitamin D is considered\u00a0\nan add-on therapy. The recommended dose is a\u00a0\u00a0 thousand to five thousand international units. One\u00a0\nimportant thing about vitamin D though: Vitamin D\u00a0\u00a0 is a fat-soluble vitamin so it can accumulate\u00a0\nin your body so you don't want to take too much\u00a0\u00a0 of it thinking that if a 1000 or\u00a0\n5000 helps then maybe 10,000\u00a0 even better. More is not better unless you have\u00a0\na deficiency and the only way to find that out\u00a0\u00a0 is to get tested. Thanks for watching this today.\u00a0\nCheck out some of my other videos.

        "Transcript": "For centuries, doctors and scientists have\ntried to unlock the mysteries of the human brain. How is it organized? Which areas control different mental functions,\nand how is it all wired together to generate our subjective psychological experience? For the past 100 years, neuroscientists have\napproached the brain like map-makers, charting its features and activities within well-defined\nboundaries. The prefrontal cortex is celebrated as the\nseat of rationality. The motor cortex plans and coordinates movement. The somatosensory cortex and parietal lobes\ncontrol our perception of the physical world. The temporal lobes process memories, language,\nand emotion. The occipital lobe processes and integrates\nvisual information. And the cerebellum helps execute our body\u2019s\nmotor commands. Scientists have looked at the brain through\nthe lens of our beliefs about what it means to be human. So when we're looking at parts of the brain,\ntrying to figure out what they do, scientists are usually using their beliefs about what\nmakes a human mind, and some of those ideas you can trace all the way back to Plato. Recent studies of traditional categories of\ncognitive brain functions, like memory, show surprising amounts of activity that overlap\ndifferent parts of the brain \u2013 so much that the simple map and its strict categories lose\ntheir meaning. The way that we've been conceptualizing the\nmind doesn't map very well at all to the functions of different systems in the brain. These kinds of distinctions are very subjective\nand it's probably better to try to look at the brain and figure out what its organizational\nproperties are without appealing to these culturally ladened categories, which aren't\nrespected by the brain. Russell Poldrack is doing just that. At his lab at Stanford University, he\u2019s\ntaking a computational approach to understanding the organizing features of our mind. If you have people perform a bunch of different\npsychological tasks that vary in the psychological functions that we think they engage, let's\ncollect a bunch of data on a bunch of different tasks and ask the data what kind of structure\nthere is. Poldrack's lab used machine learning to try\nto isolate neural activity related to memory recall. But rather than simply mapping into memory\ncenters, the data correlated with more general constructs of activity \u2014 ones for which\nwe don't yet have names. What that has shown us in some cases is that\nthings that we might've thought were measuring the same thing really don't seem to be measuring\nthe same thing at all. I think we need to fundamentally rethink how\nwe conceptualize the functions of the brain. Within neuroscience, there's a broad agreement\nthat the brain is a computational machine and we need to understand\nwhat the computations are that it's doing, and that we should be able to ultimately understand\npsychological function in terms of those computations. Part of the challenge is that we don\u2019t have\na great language for describing those computations other than math. So it raises essentially a question of whether\nwe're going to end up with models of the brain that are really good at predicting the activity\nof the brain, but that we can't sort of give human understandable explanations to. Deep in the jungles of Southeast Asia lives\nthe world\u2019s strangest flower. This is Rafflesia arnoldii. It\u2019s affectionately known as the \u201ccorpse\nflower\u201d because it smells like rotting meat to attract pollinating flies. It\u2019s the largest flower in the world, with\nthe size and weight of a small child. But the weirdness doesn\u2019t end there. Rafflesia is not just a flower\u2014it\u2019s a\nparasite. They require part or all of their nutrients\nand water from another plant. As a result, we often find alien genetic material\nin the genome of a parasitic plant\u2014many times from the host. One of the hypotheses is that parasitic plants\nsteal from the host as a weapon to make them a better parasite. Liming Cai is the latest of a long line of\nbiologists to attempt to sequence Rafflesia\u2019s notoriously unwieldy genome. Biologists struggled because the Rafflesia\ngenome features highly repetitive elements called transposons, known as jumping genes\nfor their ability to cut and paste themselves at repeating intervals. Most organisms silence these elements, but\nRafflesia is not most organisms. These highly repeated elements [are] causing\na lot of problems for a scientist trying to assemble genomes because it's basically like\nputting a jigsaw puzzle, but every piece is identical. This year, with the help of a bioinformatics\nteam, Cai successfully created a draft genome for a species of Rafflesia. Her findings were even more shocking than\nbiologists had expected. There are a couple of things going on here\nthat really sort of blew my mind in the first place and really make us rethink what defines\na plant. So all plants have a similar set of genes. In Rafflesia, what we found is that it has\nlost nearly half of the conserved plant genes, which is really a record-breaking finding. Cai also found that 90% of Rafflesia\u2019s genome\nconsists of repeating DNA, like transposons. That\u2019s highly unusual. No one knows why, but the answer may transform\nour understanding of parasite genomics. With the advances of genome sequencing technology,\nwe can explore all the weird branches of the tree of life\u2014how rules can be bent by all\nsorts of really creative strategies. Life is really diverse and nature often surprises. In the early 20th century, sleep became a\npopular topic for researchers. The weapon of choice was the newly invented\nelectroencephalograph, or EEG, a machine measuring electrical activity in the brain. This approach produced many insights, but\nit also set up a bias in the studies: that sleep is a neurological phenomenon, and its\npurpose and structure is located in the brain. Everybody has thought that sleep is of the\nbrain, by the brain, for the brain. This is a famous quote by Alan Hobson, who's\na brilliant sleep scientist that made some huge contributions to the field. But it really overlooks the fact that, in\nfact, we're not brains. We\u2019re organisms, we\u2019re integrated. Everything we do is integrated with everything\nelse. The first cracks in this brain-centric view\nstarted to show when the Swiss scientist Irene Tobler noticed that cockroaches sleep. Since then, we\u2019ve learned that simpler creatures,\nwith less and less brain, also sleep. And recently, a new discovery has changed\nthe narrative entirely. This is a hydra. It\u2019s one of the simplest forms of animal\nlife. Instead of a brain, hydras have nerve nets,\nthe most basic nervous systems in nature. This year, a group of Japanese scientists\ndemonstrated that hydras sleep. These tiny fresh-water organisms are living\nproof that sleep evolved before brains. But if sleep didn\u2019t evolve in and for the\nbrain, what is it for? More and more scientists are really looking\nin peripheral tissues and asking how the body can impact the brain and how the brain can\nimpact the body specifically with respect to sleep regulation. In my lab, the current hypothesis is that\nthere are some situations that the brain can't fix itself. And in association with whatever damage has\ntaken place, sleep can lower the activation energy to have these circuits begin to find\nthat solution. So the idea then is that when you're asleep,\nyou're using less energy, but the energy that you are using, you're using in a different\nway that you're supporting functions that you would not be able to otherwise support\nif you were awake. The research on hydras is the latest in a\ngrowing body of evidence that sleep first evolved to help regulate metabolism and enhance\nrepair, and only later took on brain-related functions. I really do believe that sleep and metabolism\nare intertwined. So that's going to be the future.",

        "Transcript": "So welcome, everyone to A\nCloser Look, where today, we're going to take\na closer look at stem cells and human longevity. I'm Robert Signer, I'm an associate professor in the Division of\nRegenerative Medicine, and the Deputy Director of the Sanford Stem Cell\nDiscovery Center, which is part of the\nSanford Stem Cell Institute here at UC San Diego. I'm here today to take\nyou on an adventure. Now, our adventure is to discover what many of us\nbefore have been looking for. This goes from ancient kings to great explorers to prolific\nminds of the enlightenment to fictional action heroes\nand to billionaire tech bros. We are looking for the fountain of youth\nand the Elixir of life. But our adventure won't involve circumnavigating\nthe globe. It won't involve\nbathing in magic waters or trekking through\nbooby trap jungles. No, our adventure is\ngoing to be right here. Because in each and every one of us deep inside our bones, hidden within the inner\nworkings of our stem cells, I believe is the\nfountain of youth. Now, before we set off\non this adventure, let's talk about the\nmission of this adventure. Now, when we're looking\nfor the fountain of youth, well, sure, we all want to live to put more\ncandles on that birthday cake. But I think what we really want is to be sure that\nwe have the health, the strength, and the gusto to blow out all those\ncandles along the way. So our mission is to\nextend human health span. Now, I'm sure you all\nknow what lifespan is, but for some of you, I'm guessing that health\nspan might be a new term. So I want you to\nthink of health span as the time that we live\nfree of major diseases. That is the time in which our lives in which\nwe're healthy. Now, lifespan is\neasy to quantify. In the United States, expected lifespan\nis about 79 years. Health span, however, is a little harder to\nput a number two, but people have been trying. Now, one recent study looked at the incidence and average\nonset of all major diseases, and they estimated\nthat health span in the United States\nis about 63 years. When I heard that, two\nthings jumped out at me. One, 63 is not very old. Two, We're living\nabout 16 years on average or nearly 20% of our life after we've\ndeveloped a major disease. What's our mission? Well, it's not only to extend lifespan, but it's really about\nextending health span. We want to compress the period of our lives\nthat are marked by morbidity so that we are living\nlonger, healthier lives. How do we do this?\nWell, let's first consider the diseases that are restricting our health span. There are four diseases often referred to as the\nfour horsemen of human disease that are really the major drivers\nof morbidity as we age. These include cancer,\ncardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases\nlike Alzheimer's, and metabolic diseases\nlike diabetes. These four horsemen, well, they have one thing in common, and that is that the\nnumber 1 risk factor for all of these classes\nof diseases is aging. I have to deliver some bad news. These aren't the only diseases. Lung disease, arthritis,\nosteoporosis, cataracts, hearing loss, back\nand neck pain, depression, and\noutcomes from COVID-19. Every single one of them, the leading cause is aging. The incidence of all of these diseases doesn't\njust go up with age, it goes up exponentially\nas we get older. In fact, by the time we\nturn just 28-years-old, aging is the number\none risk factor for disease and death. What do we do about it? What do scientists\nand physicians? What do they do?\nWhat's the approach? Well, the approach\nhas always been, if these diseases are\ncausing the problem, we have to treat or\nprevent these diseases. We've done this in a very\ndisease focused way. We have research that\nfocuses on cancer. We have research that focuses\non Alzheimer's disease. We have research that focuses on cardiovascular\ndisease and diabetes. But I think it's time for\nus to change this paradigm. If we can understand and treat the main cause of these\ndiseases, that is, we can treat aging\nor maybe we have the opportunity to prevent\nmultiple age related diseases. I believe that the key to\ndoing this lies in stem cells. So what are stem cells? Well, stem cells that I'm going to be talking\nabout today are very rare cells that exist in each and every one of\nus in various tissues. Stem cells have two superpowers. The superpower number 1 is that stem cells have the ability\nto what we call self-renew. That is, they can make\nmore of themselves and replenish our stem cells\nthroughout our life. Superpower number\n2 for stem cells, is they have the ability to\nwhat we call differentiate. That is they are a blank slate, and they can produce all\nof the different types of specialized cells that exist\nwithin a given tissue. Now, the major type of stem cell that I'm going to\nbe talking about today and that we work on in my laboratory are called hematopoietic\nstem cells. These are blood\nforming stem cells that live in our bone marrow. Now, these stem\ncells, as I said, contain this superpower\nof self renewal, and they differentiate\nto give rise to all of our different\ntypes of blood cells. This includes things like red\nblood cells and platelets, but also all of the\nwhite blood cells of our immune system. The problem is that as we age, those stem cell\nsuperpowers start to wane, and this happens in a\nfew different ways. The first affects the\npower of self-renewal. Sometimes stem cells lose\ntheir ability to self renew. As we age, this leads to\na loss of stem cells and ultimately a loss\nof their ability to produce all of these other\ntypes of blood cells. Now, in the blood, this can lead to disorders like anemia, clotting deficiencies,\nand immune dysfunction. Now, the opposite of\nthis can happen too. Stem cells can lose control of their\nability to self-renew, or other cells learn to hijack stem cell self\nrenewal activity. When this happens, we lose control of our\ngrowth of those cells. They overgrow, and this drives\nthe development of cancer. But it's not just self\nrenewal that goes awry with aging, it's\nalso differentiation. Normally, these stem\ncells differentiate in a very balanced\nmanner to produce the right number of each cell\nthat we need in our body. As we age, our blood\nforming stem cells lose this balance. What happens is that they\nstart to overproduce a certain type of white blood\ncell called myloid cells. These are inflammatory\ncells that can drive things like\nchronic inflammation and inflammatory disease, and they stop producing\nlymphoid cells. Lymphoid cells are\nthe ones that are really there to fight infection. As we get older, our ability to fight infection goes down, and we suffer from\nchronic inflammation and inflammatory diseases. This is why I believe\nthat studying blood forming stem cells in particular is really important because it's not only impacting\ndiseases of the blood, but it's impacting all sorts\nof other diseases because of its role in the immune\nsystem and in inflammation, so that defects in blood forming stem cells affect our health\nfrom our knees, to our hearts, to our brains, and everything in between. Now, what causes\nstem cells to age? Well, in general,\nI think we know that aging is\nconnected with stress. We can see it on the outside, we can feel it on the inside. Stem cells also age\nbecause of stress. But how does a stem\ncell experience stress? What does stress mean at the cellular and\nmolecular level? This is where the work in my lab is making\nkey breakthroughs, where we've been the first\nto discover that aging is happening through stress on proteins within our stem cells. Before we dive into that, let's take a step back\nand make sure we all understand exactly\nwhat a protein is. Proteins are the functional\nproducts of genes. What does that mean? Well, we know we've all heard of DNA. We have lots of it packed\ninto all of our cells that encodes about 20,000\ndifferent genes. Each of those genes is the instructions for\nhow to build a protein. That DNA is converted\ninto what's called mRNA, and that mRNA is the blueprint\nfor building a protein. A protein is what actually\ndoes something in the cell. It is the functional product, it is doing things. Let me explain this\na little more, and let me give you an analogy. The proteins are like\napps on your phone. Somewhere, someone has\nwritten a bunch of computer code that is\nburied within your phone. Think of that as the DNA. Now, that has to be interpreted by the\nmachine and stored, and that's really just a\nbunch of zeros and ones. Think of that as the mRNA. But when it converts it\nto something tangible, something that you can use, like the apps on your phone\nthat you open all the time, that you use to complete\ndifferent tasks, well, those are the proteins. The process of making proteins is so fundamentally\nimportant to life, that for decades, we've\nbelieved that it must be happening the same way\nin every type of cell. Except what we've discovered\nis that stem cells manage this process of\nprotein production completely differently\nthan other kinds of cells. What we found about 10\nyears ago now is that stem cells make proteins\nunusually slowly. Stem cells are the\nproverbial tortoise. They believe that slow\nand steady wins the race. Like the tortoise, stem\ncells are long lived. Other cells, well, they\nmake protein fast, and they are the\nproverbial hare. They live fast and die young. Now, why do stem cells need\nto make protein so slowly? Well, it turns out by\nmaking protein slowly, they're making it\nmore accurately, they're making fewer errors. You can think of when you're\nmaking protein very quickly, you're going to\nstart to put them together in ways that\naren't always the best. When that happens, what we call this is protein misfolding. These misfolded\nproteins you can really think of as the trash of a cell. The cell doesn't want these. Why? One, they don't work the way that\nthey're supposed to work. Two, if you make all this trash, it starts to pile up, and that can start to affect all other processes in the cell. Stem cells really\ncare about this. They do not want\ntrash to pile up, they are in it for\nthe long haul. Now, this process is\nso important that stem cells don't only count on making less mistakes\nwhen they make protein, they also have a completely\ndifferent plan to deal with those mistakes\nand get rid of those bad proteins\nor protein trash. Stem cells take\nthat protein trash, which is shown here in red, and they try to consolidate\nit in one area of the cell. Then what they do is they\nbuild a cage around it, that's shown in green. But this cage of protein trash isn't just a protein landfill\nin the stem cells, turns out it's actually\na recycling plant. Stem cells preferentially use a very specialized\nrecycling pathway to break down and reuse\nall of those resources, because remember, stem cells need to care about\nsustainability. They are in it for\nthe long haul. Now, what happens when we age? Well, these systems\nstart to fall apart. This protein trash starts to accumulate and pile up\nin our aging stem cells. This stresses out\nour stem cells and makes them start to\nmalfunction as we get older. But there are some good news. The stem cells, they don't\ngo down without a fight. They sound the alarm and\nthey call in reinforcements. Meet heat shock\nfactor 1 or HSF1, which I think of as a superhero\nprotein that gets called into action in stressed\nand aging stem cells. You can see it enter the nucleus of the cell where\nit interacts with the DNA, and it launches a\nprogram to help reduce protein trash and to help stem cells cope with this accumulation of\nthese misfolded proteins. Here is what happens. We have young stem cells that do a good job at keeping this\nprotein trash at bay. Those stem cells have lots\nof energy and lots of potential to\nregenerate our tissues for a long period of time. As we age, that protein trash builds\nup in those stem cells, and their power is lost. But our aging stem cells\ncall in the reinforcements, they activate this\nHSF1 superhero, and they're able to partially reduce the amount of\ntrash that's building up and maintain more of this\nregenerative potential. Is this the answer? Do we just need to supercharge HSF1 and now we can reverse\nthe effects of aging? Well, I hate to break it to\nyou, but there's a catch. Stem cells aren't the only\ncells that like HSF1. Cancer cells really like HSF1. What we found is that HSF1\nboosts the expansion of precancerous stem cells and supports the development\nof cancer as we get older. This is the ultimate catch 22. Stem cells are fighting\nthe forces of aging to stay fit and keep\nregenerating our tissues, but to do that, they have to elevate our\nrisk of getting cancer. The stem cells are literally\nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. What I've realized is that the answer is right\nin front of us. The blueprint for the\nfountain of youth is already pre-wired into\nlong lived stem cells. Stem cells know they\ndon't want to have to deal with that trash\nand that stress, and that they know\nthat calling and reinforcements can\nonly do so much. The stem cells secret\nto longevity is preventing the production and\npile up of protein trash. We're taking that blueprint, and we're trying to better it. How do we make stem cells even better at preventing this trash? Well, we've taken all\nsorts of approaches, and we're starting to test\nit in the lab right now, and the results are amazing. We have young stem cells. They have their\nregenerative potential, but eventually exhaust. We have old stem cells that\nstart to accumulate trash. They call in reinforcements. They can partially\nblock the problem, but like we talked about, this can lead to cancer. We've made old super stem cells. These stem cells are\neven better than normal stem cells at preventing\nthe buildup of trash. They're less stressed out, and they live longer. But it's not just about\nstem cell fitness. Our goal is to prevent disease. Is that something\nwe can really do by keeping our stem cells fit? Well, we're working\non this right now, and I've never been more excited about what we're discovering. Let me share one piece\nof that with you today. This is the spleen\nfrom a healthy mouse. What we can do is to introduce a cancer causing\nmutation that drives a very aggressive\nform of blood cancer. Within weeks, you can see the effect on the\nmouse's spleen. When we do the same thing in our mice that carry\nthese super stem cells, we don't see that cancer coming. Maybe we have found\nthe fountain of youth, maybe it really\ndoes exist within each of our stem cells\nand providing us the path forward that preventing\nthe accumulation of trash is the key to long\nhealth and long life. As Benjamin Franklin said, an ounce of prevention is\nworth a pound of cure. Let me take a moment to thank my really incredible\nand brilliant team that's been working on\nall of this research. I'm very fortunate to work with them every single day\nas well as our many collaborators and our sources of funding that support our work.\nThank you for listening. With that, I'm going to pass the baton to my incredibly\ntalented colleague, Dr. Shiri Gur-Cohen, who you heard about\nearlier. Dr. Gur-Cohen. Welcome, everyone and thank\nyou so much for coming. I would like to take\nthis opportunity, also to thank the whole\nSanford Stems Institute team for putting this\nall together and bringing us all together to celebrate the beautiful\nthings about stem cells. Because today, all of us in this room are the youngest\nwe will ever be again. If we are lucky enough, we will all age. But what if aging\nis not inevitable? What if we could\ngrow old with time, but not really be worried about age related\ndisorders and diseases? My name is Shiri. I'm an\nassistant professor at the Division of\nGenerative Medicine at UC San Diego\nSchool of Medicine. Today, I would like\nto discuss with you the unique approach\nthat we're taking in my laboratory to make that question of\nliving a healthy life for as long as possible\nto become a question of when and not just\na question of if. Let me just start\nby something that I find to be truly fascinating. It's the ability of our\nbody to regenerate itself. It has a remarkable ability\nto regenerate itself. In fact, every day\nwe are losing and replacing billions of cells and this is completely normal. The way that I like to\nthink about it is that we all know how we\nwoke up this morning, but we must have\nchanged several times since then at the\ncellular level. We are not the same person\nanymore. Think about it. Every one of your organ as we speak, is constantly\nregenerating. Some organs replace\nthemselves very fast, like the intestine in\nthe gut or our skin. Some organs replace themselves very slow like the muscles. But the key player in this regenerative process are\nour stem cells in our body. Stem cells are not\nresiding by themselves. They are not just doing what they're supposed\nto do by themselves. They're surrounded\nby multiple types of stem cells and other\ncells as well. They're receiving multiple\ncues that tells them what to do and when to do when and where to\nregenerate a tissue. Think about it like a seed. Even the driest seed, if you put it in the right soil giving the right nutrients, the right amount of moist, and the right amount of light, it will regenerate and\nproduce the flowers. Very similarly, also\nour stem cells, they reside in areas that\nwe call or term niches. Those niches produce\nall the good stuff that stem cell need or telling the stem cells when and where to\nproduce a tissue. One way to think about it is that our stem cells\nare very unique because they have the ability\nto make more of themselves, to self renew and to maintain their pool of\nstem cells in our body. But they can also\ncreate the tissue. In order to do that, they are exposed to\nmultiple types of signals that can come from\nblood vessels, nerve fibers. They can come from\nthe mature tissue in which they reside in, immune cells, if we are\nexposed to infection. All of those signals can really tell each\nand every one of those stem cells at different points or different\nplaces in the tissue. What exactly to produce, which cell to produce, how much to produce of that\nin order to create a tissue. From a single stem cells, we can actually rebuild an\norgan at the end of the day. Stem cell holds the\npower regeneration, but stem cells can age. If you're already\npast the age of 25, I think you can agree\nwith me that regeneration is an arrow with a one\nnegative direction. We're all going to\nage and it takes more and more time\nfor stem cells to do what they used to\ndo very efficiently. But what if it's not inevitable? What if those stem cells will be tricked to think\nthat they're actually young, to do exactly what they used\nto do when we were young? In order for us to answer those questions and to\ndive into the problem of what is happening\nto the stem cells and if we can trick them to think if they're\nyoung for a longer time, we need to first figure out how do we know that we're aging. Because none of us have\nthose special glasses to look inside of our tissues and look at our gut and say, today did not\nregenerate very fast, or our lungs did not do what they're\nsupposed to be today. There's one organ in our body that each\nand every one of you look right in the morning when you're waking up and\ngoing to wash your face. This is your skin, the\nlargest organ of our body. I'll ask each and\nevery one of you, who is the old person and who is the young person\nin this picture, everyone will be able\nto address that. The reason is that you\ncan see the fine line, the texture, the\ncolor of the hair, the wounds that didn't heal. All of that is very clear for us that something is happening. How fast are we aging? How fast can our\nskin actually age? It turns that when\nwe were young, when we're babies, we can\nreplace our skin very fast. Within two weeks, we have\na completely new skin. I think every parent here in\nthe audience can test that, if their kids had a scratch\nor something like that, within a few days, that it was completely gone. But as we grow older, those small scratches are no\nlonger small scratches and it takes more and\nmore time for them to heal and to close the wound. The real problem of this is that those small little\nwounds can turn to be chronic wounds that\nsimply never heals, and that's really\nthe real problem. Because if you think\nabout the amount of people in the United States\nwith chronic wounds, exceed the number of people that suffer from breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon\ncancer combined. It's a lot of people and\nit's a major health burden. We know that chronic\nwound disease will usually be more in older patients and we do see\nwithin the past five years, more and more people suffering from chronic wound diseases. We need a better solution. We need to better\nunderstand how we can make those stem cells do what\nthey're supposed to do. Ever since I was a little girl, I was always intrigued by the things that are hidden\nfrom the naked eye. The fact that I don't see doesn't mean that\nit doesn't exist. In my laboratory, we are\nusing the microscope that enables us to see cells at the cellular level,\nwhat are they doing? When are they doing\nit and really zooming in on those stem cells that\nregenerate our tissues. Now, if I will ask each and\nevery one of you to look at the palm of your hand\nor the back of your hand, you won't see much moving. You will see your hand, but\nnothing more than that. But through the microscope, we can see our stem cells. Those that reside really\ndeep in our tissues, they are moving a lot. They're constantly active. They are talking\nwith each other. They're almost as if they're\ndancing with each other. They're sensing\neach other to make sure that our tissues are constantly regenerating\nand constantly repairing what needs\nto be repaired. Your tissues are\ndefinitely not static and thinking about the skin is the largest organ of our body, it's also the largest home for the multiple types\nof stem cells. It's a home for the\nepidermal stem cells that will create your skin. It's a home for\nmelanocyte stem cells, that will create the\ncolor of our hair, the color of our skin. It's also a home for the hair follicle stem\ncells that will create, in my view, at least, beautiful structures\nof the hair follicle. If we look at those\nhair follicle as a mini organ that exists in each and every one of our skin, we can see that\nwhen we're young, the hair follicle will spend\nabout half of their time in the resting phase and then half of their time in a\nmore active phase. As we grow older and older, those hair follicle will spend less of their time\non the growth phase. I think a lot of\npeople can feel on their own body\nthat their hair is not growing as fast\nas it used to be. Those dynamics in rest to activation is not\nonly true in aging, but it's actually true for many types of\ndifferent stressors. We know that when\nwe are stressed, it's a common belief that\nwe are starting to lose the pigments of our hair\nand we're turning gray. We know or every woman that was pregnant will\nsay that that was the best time of her\nlife that her hair grew as beautiful as possible. We also know that when\nwe don't sleep as much, our skin looks dull and not\nas bright as it used to be. All of those things is things\nthat you can wake up in the morning and clearly see,\nsomething is happening. Maybe, what we are actually\nseeing on the surface of our skin is actually a mirror to our internal\norgans because again, we don't have that magical\nglasses to tell us, our internal organs and other important organs are now regenerating to the same extent. In my lab, we're trying to take a unique approach by\nasking how all of those systemic changes in those systemic if we slept\nenough or what we ate, if we're stressed,\nhow the stem cells can know all of those\nsystemic changes. The unique approaches\nthat we are looking at the connection\nbetween stem cells to their vascular system, because the vascular system is actually connecting all\nof our body together. It creates a network in\nour body that can transfer information from one\nside to the other and, it's really a good\nmodel to study how stem cell feel that stress. Usually when I talk about\nthe vascular system, most of you guys be\nprobably thinking about the blood vascular\nsystem, which is true. This is a system that will carry blood and nutrients\ninto the tissues, but we also have one\nmore vascular system that is less studied, and this is the lymphatic\nvascular system. The lymphatic system, although less studied is very important because as we have the blood circulatory system that will transfer information, the lymphatic system will\nbe there to drain back all of those fluids,\nimmune cells toxin, fats and proteins back into the circulatory system and\nfor immune prevalence. If the lymphatic system is not working as good as\nit's supposed to do, now we have a lot of\nfluids, lots of proteins, lots of toxins, accumulating\nin the tissues, and that's probably not\nwhat we want to have. One way to think\nabout it is like if you are stuck in a\nrainy day in the city, one thing that you really\nwant to have is an umbrella, but you're also trusting\nthe city to make sure that the drainage system of\nthe city is working properly, so you're not getting wet. But if the drainage\nsystem is now working, I don't think umbrella will\nhelp you in this case, so you will get very wet. In fact, what we know is that dysfunctional\nemphatic system, whether its drainage or its architecture is associated with many age\nrelated pathologies, including Alzheimer, including\nautoimmune diseases, chronic wounds that I mentioned, cardiovascular diseases,\ndiabetes, cancers, and more. We are trying to understand\nin my laboratory, can the vascular system really guard stem cell youthfulness. Vascular system is\nthe key for us to understand how stem cells can maintain their youth potential. But to answer that question, we have a little\nhurdle to pass because the vascular system is a\nthree dimensional system. It's a very complex system to visualize under the\nmicroscope, as I told you. Think about it like you're taking an image under the water. There's a lot of structure,\nbeautiful colors, but you can't really see\nit all look very opique. But we have a way in\ntechnology to actually make that opique picture\ncompletely transparent, so we can appreciate the color, the texture, and the\narchitecture of that picture. In a very similar way, what we're doing is\nwe're taking our skin, which is completely opique and turning it to be\ncompletely transparent. Now we can visualize those complex structure of the vascular system in the resolution of\nthe intact tissue. This is what we were finding in a very surprising way is that the hair follicle stem cells here in green were tightly associated with the lymphatic vascular\nsystem here in red. Now we can look at this in a\nthree dimensional picture, and you can appreciate how the stem cells are nesting\non top of the lymphatics, almost as if it\nwas their cushion. But that is very peculiar. Why I'm saying\nthat it's peculiar because why would you put in your body the most\nimportant component your stem cells next\nto a garbage can? It does not make a lot of sense. Why would you put this very\nimportant component there? Maybe it's only in\nthe hair follicle, but not in any other organ so we turn to look at other epithelial\norgan, and in this case, we looked at the\nintestine because the hair follicle undergo\ncycles of activation, but the intestine is constantly regenerating so maybe there they actually don't\nneed lymphatics. Again, we employ similar\nthree dimensional imaging of the vascular system, and so what you can see here is a reconstruction of\nthe vascular system in a three dimensional way. We could visualize\nthe blood vessels and the lymphatic vessels, and what we were able to\nfind is that the lymphatics really creating a network where the stem cells\nusually reside. Indeed, we found that\nthey got stem cells, those who will create and\nregenerate our intestine, also nesting the lymphatic\nvascular system. It's not only true for the hair, it's also true for\nthe intestine. As opposed to what\nwe were tending to think is that the lymphatic is only a trash system in the body, maybe it's actually the\nnew gold that stem cells really need for their\nregenerative capacity. Is it true? Why are we\nlosing hair as we age? Are we losing the stem cell, then at the end of the\nday, there's no hope? Or are we losing the soil? What really needs to\nbe there to provide those inductive signal for the stem cells to\nregenerate our organs. We wanted to ask that question, but it's not a\nvery easy question to ask because in our tissues, we have multiple type of\nstem cells, as I mentioned. Think about it like\na pile of lego. Within all this pile of lego, you have just a small piece, a few pieces that\ncompose the stem cells. In the lab, what we are\nable to do is actually sort all of those\nstem cells and ask each and every one\nof that cubes, what are they expressing? What is their identity, and what is happening to them? Are they different between young stem cells\nand age stem cells? The only thing that I\nreally wanted to take from that picture is that\nit's almost identical. When we looked at the age\ncubes and on the young cubes, they look almost the same. A little bit less,\na little bit more, but overall, their identity maintained\nalmost at the same level. Clearly, they do not do what\nthey're supposed to do, and they're not growing here. What is happening?\nWhat is wrong? Together with my\ncolleague, [inaudible], we decided to take this imaging\napproach because again, I enjoy looking at\nthose stem cells. What we were able\nto see is that in the young stem cells\nhere in green, those young stem cells create a structure that is very\nimportant for their behavior, we call it the bulge, the stem cell niche. When we looked at\nthe old stem cells, all of a sudden, they lost this architecture. They completely collapse\ninto one signal structure and did not maintain the bulge structure as\nwe were expecting to. What I do want to draw\nyour attention to though, is that the stem cells\nare still there. There's still hope. What is happening to the\nlymphatic on the other hand? I think you can clearly\nappreciate that the lymphatic system in the aged skin completely\ncollapse as well. Their structure, their function, their architecture\nis no longer intact. But what happened about their connection\nwith the stem cells? Are they still connecting\nwith the stem cells? We took a look at this\nconnection as well. Here lymphatics are in blue, and the stem cells are in yellow,and we were\nable to see is that the stem cells are still being nutriented by the blood vessels, but they are very far\naway from the lymphatics. They are no longer nesting\nlymphatic anymore. In the lab, we're able to use transgenic\nanimal to actually impose that collapse of the structure of the\nlymphatic vascular system. Using transgenic animals, we\nare able to express or to remove a protein that comes from the stem cells themselves that regulate lymphatic function. We're able to take\nyoung skin and turn it basically to almost as if it was an old skin in terms of the\nlymphatic vascular system. What is happening to their hair? Normally, we have\nhair follicles all synchronized at the same stages, but when their lymphatic\nis collapsing, they're starting to\nbecome asynchronized. You can see small follicles\nwith big follicles, and those big follicles\nthat became asynchronous, they're also become\nvery fast hyperplastic. At the end of the day, what we found is what\nyou can see here in this picture are\nbasically twins, they were born to\nthe same mum at the same day, the same time. One of them has a completely\nnormal lymphatic system, and the other one has a\ncollapsed lymphatic system. What we found is the mouse, even though it's young, that has a collapsed\nlymphatic system, now starts to lose\nhair precautiously. At the time we normally, they need to grow hair\njust as if it was young. We can speed up aging very fast, but can we actually reverse it? I think this is what you\nguys are more interested in. My colleague actually did a\nvery interesting experiment, we took young stem cells, and we took old stem cells. We also took the environment that those stem cells reside in, the young environment,\nand the old environment, and now we mixed and\nmatched between them. What we found is\nthat if you take young stem cells and you just put them in an\nold environment, they're not able to\nregenerate an organ, they're not able to\ngrow hair anymore. But when you take the\nold stem cells and you put them simply in a\nyoung environment, that was sufficient for them to be tricked to think\nthat they're young, to think that now I am a young stem cells and to regenerate an organ\nand to grow hair. This is all very exciting and while we are still in search of what exactly this young\nenvironment is doing, we still need to figure out\nalso if it's true in humans. As part of the vascular\ntheory of aging that put the vascular system at the center of the aging process, vascular aging is a key\nmechanism for aging. What has been shown\nbefore is that by simply turning your vascular system\nto just remain fit better, just to become better within your body\nand not to decline, what they found is that\nit can delay aging and enhance longevity and\nlifespan of these mice. There's much more to be done\nand although if most of you thought or were anxious to get out of here today with a\npill to just look better, or look younger, aging\nscience takes a long time. The reason for it is\nnot just because we are interested or waiting for\nthose processes to happen, waiting to see if we can\nactually delay aging, we also need to make sure that\nwhat we're doing is safe. The reason for that\nsafety is that stem cells can function\nas a double edge sword, and when stem cell\nbalanced cell behavior is not happening anymore, and they are starting to become their division and cell\nproliferation is not balanced, then they can create cancer. This uncontrolled behavior\nis something that we are very mindful for and we need to make sure that\nwhatever we're doing, every manipulation\nthat we're doing is to prevent cancer at\nthe end of the day. What's interesting\nis that if you're looking at the young\ntissue and think about each and every dot\nin this picture as genetic alternation\nin stem cells, so those cells have a lot\nof them even in the young. But the genetic alternation\nthat we see in this picture, what we call mutations, the mutation burden\njust increase with age. You can see more and\nmore of those dots, and those dots are bigger, which means that\nthose mutated cells are just growing more and more. But is it sufficient\nto create cancer? Are these mutations\nsufficient to create cancer? In fact, if you\nlook and scientists look at the normal skin and the skin area that is highly exposed to the sun\nand UV damage, they found lots of mutations\nthere, but thankfully, those tissues were not\nshowing any signs of cancer. There has to be something\nelse that it may be that those mutations are important but not sufficient\nto create cancer. Maybe the environment,\nthe soil that those mutated cells reside in can actually guide\nthem towards to become young age or\neventually cancer one. What we did in the\nlaboratories again to use genetic animals to disrupt the lymphatic system for\na longer time point. What we found is that those hair follicles that\nreside in areas with dysfunctional\nlymphatics became very big and turned to\nbe hyperplastic, really suggesting to us that\nthere is something wrong with their ability to\ncontrol their proliferation. In fact, what we found is that\nthose very big follicles, those very big stem\ncells that could not control their\nproliferation anymore, were surrounded by the most dilated and\ndysfunctional emphatic, those are the white\ncells over here. We're all living in\na very exciting time now because I showed you that lymphatic form a niche for the hair\nfollicle stem cells, for the intestinal stem cells, it's important for\nthe regeneration, for the youthfulness. Although not very\nstems centric work, others have shown that\nlymphatic vascular system is important for brain function, heart regeneration,\nand most recently been discovered to reside\nalso in the bones. Just maybe to put that\nquestion up front, maybe actually the fountain\nof youth runs within us, within our vascular system. Simply what we need\nto do is to take care of our vascular\nsystem much better because the same\nsignal that will transform to our skin\nwill go to our intestine, will go to our liver, will go to each and\nevery one of our organs, and so making those vascular\nsystem just much better fit will make those stem\ncells remain youth. I want to conclude with an\noptimistic point of view, and to cheer with\nall of you to life, growing up in a family, they always cheer to life\nwith every happy occasion. I feel that we work\nvery hard to ensure that living a healthy\nlife for as long as possible will be a\nquestion of when and if. But we all need to remember equally important to remember that to truly live our life, to make the most of the present, to celebrate successes, to\ncelebrate achievements, and really to live. With that, really to thank\nthe most important people in my lab that are really\ndoing phenomenal work, and I hope that you all\nwill be able to read more about their amazing\ndiscoveries in the future. Collaborators funding resources, and thank you so much\nfor your attention. Hi, thank you. Very nice. One of the themes both\nof you've mentioned was the build up of\nmaterial in the cells. One of the hacks that people have been using for longevity now is diet restricted calories. What you showed also\nwas the build up of proteins in the stem cells. Perhaps it should\nbe restrictions of protein because as you age, you metabolize protein\nless. Thank you. Sure. The question is\nabout dietary restriction, which has been shown in\nanimal models to extend longevity and I\nthink has inspired certain people to try to\ntake the same initiatives. Well, we know that\nnutrients matter. What we take into our body in that form can actually\nactivate growth pathway. Some of that growing\ninvolves the production of new proteins in our\ncells and can lead ultimately to some\nof the stressors that I talked about in terms of building proteins more\nquickly or incorrectly, as it may be. There is a connection between some of those\nmolecular pathways in dietary restriction\nand the pathways on protein production\nlike I talked about. But I think it's\nstill early days to understand how fully\nthat is working. I think there are certainly other things\nthat will be going on as well that both\nprobably good and bad that we need to understand\nin that regard. I think you also asked\nspecifically about eating protein. We're actually launching\na project in the lab to look at specific\ndifferent diet regimens to understand how this is affecting some of these bio-markers and the\nstem cell fitness that we talked about. There was a recent paper\nabout restriction of taurine to extend life. Taurine, it's a supplement. I've just recently seen\nthis urban legend of a Greenland shark that\nwas like 450-years-old. Does your lab look\nat examples in nature where this\nanimal is just so old, and it's kind of like working. You mentioned the tortoise. Are you guys cross\nreferencing examples of that are working in\nyour research at all? There are lots of studies\nactually that have correlated different things with\nmammalian lifespan. One of them actually has to do with protein quality as well, where there is a\nconnection there. Now, accessing some of those animals to work on\nthem can be challenging, and there are people that are\ndoing those and working in particularly long\nlived organisms. But we definitely use that as a guidance based on\nwhat's already known to say, are we on the right track here? Maybe we should be thinking about something a\nlittle bit different. I think in a similar way what we are trying\nto understand is if similar pathways that we are looking at and\nwhether in our view, vascular system or\ndrainage system, consistent with animals\nthat, for example, live longer or\nlive shorter life. We are always looking\nat that back and forth. But I think an interesting\nway to think about that, and I just mentioned it\nvery briefly about sleep, and we're spending about one\nthird of our life sleeping. Thinking about why are we\ndoing it and how within animals that either live longer\nor live very short life, how those processes that can again transform through\nthe vascular system will guide stem cells to become more youth or\nactually old faster. We're looking at actually how systemic things that\nhappen within those animals, such as sleep and stress\nwill affect similarly or differently across\ndifferent organisms. Cool, if you don't mind,\nI have another question. Do you have any real\ntimeline for when there might be a breakthrough\nfor this thing? Where is the peal? I think we have to be realistic and see that breakthroughs are\nhappening all the time. The changes that are\nhappening to our health, our well being, we all see\nthem in our lifetimes. I'm sure you remember a time\nwhen it was rare to meet a cancer survivor and now I bet everyone in this room knows\nmultiple cancer survivors. We are making progress. Progress takes time. It's hard to put a\nspecific timeline on it, but it's constant. Sometimes it's slow and\nsometimes it's quick, but we're always working\nto move forward. I'm curious about inflammation. Have you guys seen any\ndifferences in your old versus young stem cells in terms of inflammatory gene expression, is it being reversed\nwhen you get rid of all those proteins\naccumulating? Do you see any changes in\nrecruitment of immune cells when you transplant the cells\ninto a different niche? I'm curious you guys fine. I want to start? Go ahead. In terms of the immune system, my background is\nactually in immunology, when I moved from the\nhematopoietic system to the skin. One of the things\nthat I of course, looked at is the immune system and what is happening there. I think in age, what we do see is a lot of changes within the\nimmune system. The immune system by itself\nundergo aging processes. What's interesting, I think, with the lymphatic\nvascular system is that it's known at least to have this ability to drain the immune cells\nto the lymph nodes. What we do know\nis that with age, that drainage process decrease. I think we can relate that\nto a lot of immune diseases, at least that we\nknow that happen more and more in age\nbecause we don't have that teaching\nor the school of all of the pathogens that immune cells can eat and then\nteach the immune system, this is a bad thing. Those are things that we\nclearly seen age individuals. The real question, I think is how we can actually improve it. We are, and I think it's very exciting to think\nabout this because we have ways now to improve\nlymphatic drainage much better. If we can do that, maybe we can prevent\nthe whole problem with immune system in\nolder individuals. Exciting, but we're\nnot there yet, as Rob just mentioned. Over here. Would you comment on the DNA methylation\nclock in aging? I don't know how that integrates with the work you're doing. You want me to take this one? What the question\nis referring to is that there are a lot\nof efforts to establish molecular clocks of\naging so that we can look inside a cell and say, how old is this cell at\nthe molecular level, not just in terms of\nchronological age. This has been looking at\nsomething called methylation, which is something that\nit accessorizes our DNA, and allows genes to\nturn on and off at different rates and there are many changes that happen\nwith these with age. There's been a lot of\neffort to establish these molecular aging clocks and I'll say that the jury's\na little bit still out. There are papers coming out\nall the time, wondering, what is the connection here. We don't fully understand what these clocks are telling us. There are some that\nlook really accurate, some that make us scratch\nour heads a little more, but we haven't yet drawn the connection mostly because we haven't looked yet at that particular\naspect of things. It's possible that there\nwill be a connection. The Claal Foundation has a methylation array that you\ncan just send your sample, and they can tell you\nwhat your cells are, compare it to everything else. Can just maybe comment a\nsmall thing about this is just thinking\nabout methylation, any changes that we have, the accessories that we're putting on our DNA at\nthe end of the day, how dynamic it is, in many ways. If there is a clock\nthat is being imposed by those changes that\nare happening methylation, for example, how\ndynamic they are. Are they telling us about the potential of the stem cells. Hopefully, we'll read soon about the work that we're\nworking on right now, but it seems that a lot of those changes can\nactually be imposed by the lymphatic vascular system as well methylation,\nand acetylation. I think, we don't know exactly if it is\ncorrelates with aging, but it's very dynamic, and it really tells us what the potential of the\nstem cells will be. That's an interesting\nthing because we can change the\npotential whether to do what they're supposed to do just to\nregenerate an organ, maybe to become plastic to\nregenerate a different organ, and maybe just to rejuvenate. It's really exciting times, I think in that regards. Well, I want to\nthank doctor Cohen. Thank you. Doctor at Jamison, we have a incredible staff of people that put\nthis event together. Thank you to Marcy and Katherine and who else\nI can't see back there. There's an entire team. Thank you all Kiersten. Thank you all for putting\nthis amazing event together.

Genes from any plant or animal\ncan be combined to create new hybrid organisms\nresilient to climate change. This technique can even\nrestore extinct species. Doctors can detect every known\ngenetic disorder early on and repair mutations quickly, giving children\nhappy and healthy lives. - Our environmental clock\nis ticking.

That is incredible. The rise of\ngenetic engineering. [dramatic music] \u266a \u266a My name is Kondwani Phiri.\nI'm a genetic researcher. You can say it's in my blood. From an early age of\nabout eight or nine or so, I had just a natural curiosity\nfor the natural world. Cancer runs in my family. In fact, I lost my aunt\nto breast cancer. And that piqued my interest\nin genetics. I'm fascinated by\nhow the genes we inherit shape our biological destiny,\nincluding our health. I believe the key\nto treatment and cures for diseases like these lies in explicit efforts\nto engineer human genes. But can we fix\nnot only what's broken, but also enhance\nour genetic codes and improve on Mother Nature? Someday, will humans direct their own evolution,\nand should we? [inquisitive music] I'm starting my journey\nin Washington D.C. to visit a family\nwho's grappling with the difficulties\ncaused by genetic disease. Hello!\nHi, Annabel. - Can you shake hands, Annabel?\n- Hi. Oh, my gosh.\nHow are you? Oh, I think she's shy.\n[chuckles] Four-year-old Annabel Frost has a heart-wrenching\ngenetic disorder. Could you tell me\na little bit about Annabel? - When Annabel was born,\nit was such a wonderful moment. But we were in this happy fog\nand didn't notice the nystagmus,\nthe eye movements. We didn't notice\nthe jerky muscle movements. We didn't notice any of that. But the doctors realized\nthat something was wrong. - They diagnosed Annabel with alternating hemiplegia\nof childhood, or AHC. - Hi. - This extremely rare disorder causes debilitating spells\nof paralysis, delayed development,\nand life-threatening seizures. - She'd have days of paralysis where her whole\none side of her body, she'd drag it along\nbehind her as she crawled. - You know, once a day she will\nhave these choking episodes where I need to pick her up\nand hit her on the back to make sure\nthat she can breathe. - Annabel's condition is a result of a problem\nin her DNA. The twisting double helix\nof DNA is made up of four different base pairs\nor nucleotides. The unique sequence\nof these base pairs are instructions for the body\nto make proteins. The base pairs are like\nmusical notes in a score that tell a musician\nhow to play a song. When all\nthe different sections of the DNA are played, the result is\na biological symphony. [lively classical music] But like a musical note\nplayed out of key that compromises\nthe entire performance, there is an error\nin one of Annabel's genes. - [cries] - The mutation\nin the ATP1A3 gene is disrupting her nerve cells, leading to\nher severe condition. AHC is\nfundamentally intertwined in her genetic code. There is no restorative\ntreatment or cure. - The medicines that they have\nare kind of more about masking symptoms in a very\nunspecific, untargeted way. - And we wanted to try to\nfigure out if there was a way to address the cause\nand not the symptoms. - Without targeted treatment,\nAnnabel could die any day. both: \u266a Happy birthday\ndear Annabel \u266a - There's a timeline\non this for us. We've got a ticking clock in the back of our minds\nall the time. - The Frosts are desperate\nfor any kind of help. From sickle cell anemia\nto Huntington's disease, millions of people suffer from thousands of genetic disorders\nmuch like Annabel's. Unless scientists can address\nthese genetic errors, children like Annabel will\nsuffer agonizing pain, and some will die young. I want to know,\ncan genetic engineering help families like this\nin the future? Oh, my God.\n- Oh, that's so nice. [dynamic music] - The double helix structure\nof DNA was first revealed in 1953\nby Rosalind Franklin, Francis Crick,\nand James Watson. And within a few decades,\nscientists discovered how to alter the DNA\nof living organisms. But gene editing\nreally took off around 2013 when scientists harnessed\na molecular mechanism found in certain bacteria. This remarkable mechanism\nis called CRISPR-Cas9, or CRISPR for short. CRISPR-Cas9 contains an enzyme\nthat serves as the bacteria's defense mechanism\nagainst viruses. When viruses\ninfect the bacteria, the CRISPR machinery targets\na specific section of DNA. Then the enzyme responds\nlike a pair of scissors and literally cuts the virus'\ngenetic code apart. Scientists are now harnessing\nthis natural mechanism to target and precisely edit\nthe DNA of numerous organisms. To find out how, I'm heading to a biotech lab\nin Brooklyn, New York. I'm on my way to Genspace, which is the world's first\ncommunity biology lab. Beth Tuck is the Director of\nScience Education at Genspace. - We are an open-access science\nlab or a community biology lab. - So are you telling me\nif I'm a computer programmer and I wanted to learn\nmore about biology, I could essentially\ncome down here and take a class and use your facility?\n- That's it. - Beth is going to show me\nhow to use CRISPR in the lab to edit a bacteria's genes\nin new and novel ways. I brought this kit. Could you explain a little bit\nhow this kit works? - Yeah, sure.\nGot a pipette. This is our measuring device. Got a rack where we'll put\nsome of our plastic tubes, some plates, petri dishes,\nand then our E. coli. - E. coli is\na type of bacteria that lives in the intestines\nof humans and animals. Though some strains can be\ndeadly, most are harmless. Gloved up.\nLet's do this. - All right, so we've got\nour E. coli here. These are called DH5-Alpha,\nwhich is a type of species that isn't harmful to people\nwith normal immune systems. - That's good to know. - So our first thing\nthat we need to do is actually get these bacteria\nout of this jar. And so you just kind of\nscoop it in there--yup. swirl it around,\nbring a little bit up. The way that\nthis experiment works is we're gonna spend a day\nto prepare the bacteria. - Next, we insert\na CRISPR construct that will alter their DNA. - So we're going to add in\nthe CRISPR machinery and then change the cells.\n- Ah. The CRISPR machinery\ntargets and edits a specific gene\nin the E. coli, so that it can adapt to\na lethal dose of antibiotics. Normally, bacteria can't grow in the presence\nof this antibiotic. The drug kills the bacteria. - We need to get\nthese bacteria onto this plate so they can grow. You're just gonna\ngently drag it across the surface\nof the plate. - That's it?\n- Yeah, that's it. - Over the course of\nseveral days, Beth grows\nthe gene-edited bacteria in a petri dish laced with the E. coli-killing\nantibiotic, but despite\nthis toxic onslaught, the genetically altered\nE. coli continued to grow. I see plenty of growth. - The whole point of this\nis to show that changing an organism's DNA\ncan change its features, and that you can do it\nwith CRISPR in a really precise way, in a way that wasn't\nfeasible before. - What kind of\npositive outcomes can we expect\nfrom using CRISPR? - You can use it to design new on-the-spot testing\nfor infectious diseases. You can use it to cut out\nHIV from human cells. There are so many more uses that we haven't\neven imagined yet. That, to me, is why\nthis stuff is so exciting. - Harnessing the natural\nability of CRISPR and transforming it\ninto a technological tool has the potential to address\nall sorts of problems. - In the future, advanced\ngene editing techniques are reworking microbes\nto create healthier lives. Bacteria are engineered into\nmany pharmaceutical factories. These microorganisms\ngenerate an inexpensive, abundant supply of medicines for diseases like malaria,\nrabies, and coronavirus. And specially modified yeast converts organic waste\ninto green bio fuels. This innovative energy source\nis not only renewable, but it also packs\nmore of a punch than regular fossil fuels. [light dramatic music] - Formulated by Charles\nDarwin, natural selection is the driving force\nof evolution. While many individuals perish,\nthe species best adapted to their environment\nsurvive and reproduce, passing along their\nadvantageous genetic traits to their offspring. These traits like height,\neye color, strength, and even personality\nare contained in genes. Over generations, the process\nof natural selection perpetually fine tunes the\nspecies at the genetic level, helping individuals\nto continually adapt to changes\nin their environment. Humans learned to direct\nthis evolutionary process through artificial selection. Through the intentional\nselection of mates, humans facilitated\nthe breeding of animal offspring\nwith desired characteristics. Arguably,\nthe first known example of artificial selection\nhappened more than 15,000 years ago when humans\ndomesticated the wolf, breeding what we now\nknow today as the dog. \u266a \u266a In agriculture, artificial\nselection has improved and even created\nnew fruits and vegetables. Through selective breeding\nfor certain traits, the simple wild mustard plant\nwas transformed into cauliflower, cabbage,\nand even broccoli. But even artificial selection takes at least\na few generations to work. Capitalizing on\nthe natural CRISPR process, gene editing in the lab can compress evolution\ndown to a matter of months. Using CRISPR to\nmanually engineer DNA is the next step\nin accelerated evolution. And with this remarkable tool, scientists can even improve\nour food supply. This matters,\nbecause over 10% of the world suffers from hunger\nand malnourishment. I'm in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina, where pioneering\nfood scientist Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou\nis using gene editing to boost food production\nand feed the planet. - We're going to be able to breed crops that are\nmore efficient, that are more resistant\nto disease. The biggest impact CRISPR\nmay have short-term, maybe the next decade or so, will to be to revolutionize\nthe food supply chain. - In fact, Rodolphe had\na hand in the discovery of the natural CRISPR\nmechanism in bacteria. And his use of CRISPR\nas a technology in milk is leading to remarkable\ninnovations in dairy products. - So what we're looking\nat here is milk that is in the process\nof fermenting. - Okay, so this is in\nthe earlier stage of things? - Very early stage. So we add the bacteria to start\nthe fermentation process and then use the lactose to solidify milk\ninto cheese and yogurt. - In most dairy facilities,\nregular bacteria and yeast kickstart\nthe fermentation process. But before starting,\nRodolphe added a twist. He used CRISPR technology to enhance the bacteria used\nin the fermentation of milk. - We used it to build\njust instant bacteria to make cheese and yogurt,\nto have better fermentations and better manufacturing\nof dairy products. - By vaccinating the bacteria, his dairy cultures\nalmost always succeed, which improves the process\nof making yogurt and cheese. Processes like these\nalso make them healthier. - CRISPR has been\na life changer. And it also has opened\ntremendous avenues to provide a healthier\nand more sustainable food supply for humanity. - But the true revolutionary potential of CRISPR technology is just now starting\nto be realized. - Other people caught on to\nusing these molecular machines to actually cut DNA\nto do genome editing, not just in bacteria,\nbut in other organisms. By understanding what CRISPR\nis and how it works, scientists were able to\ndevelop technologies that enable us to\nnow change the world. [bright electronic music] - By 2050,\nthe world population is expected to soar\nto 10 billion people. Food production will need to\nincrease 70% to catch up. To feed our growing population with the same amount\nof farm land, the mass production of\nfood must be hyper efficient. At NC State Plants\nand Microbial Biology Lab, Rodolphe's colleague,\nMary Beth Dallas, is facing\nthis daunting prospect. - I manage this lab, and I\nalso do research on cassava. - Also known as\nthe yucca plant, cassava is\nthe primary food staple of nearly one billion people. - Cassava plant\nis very close to my heart. - This root vegetable\nis kind of like a potato, and is widely grown across\nAfrica and the Americas. - They can actually harvest\nthe tubers and make flour, and they can make\nbreads out of that. They can also eat the greens.\nIt's really a nice plant. - Yeah, and me being\na native Zambian-- that's where I was born. I grew up eating cassava as\nwell as cassava leaves, so... - You know all about it.\n- I know all about it. It has a special place\nin my heart as well too. But there's a problem. A malady called\ncassava mosaic disease is ravaging\nthis critical food source. In Africa alone,\nit's destroyed cassava crops, leading to numerous famines. - You can see here\nthe devastation of the plants. It gets really thin leaves,\nand a mosaic pattern occurs. When the leaves\nget destroyed like this, they cannot\nphotosynthesize properly and the tubers\nthat are under the ground cannot get the right nutrients,\nand they get all shriveled, and then you can't use\nthe tubers for the food. We want to combat\nand try to find a way to stop the devastation\nof these crops. - To wage this war, Mary's lab must take\nan experimental approach. [energetic music] Using what's called\na gene gun, CRISPR-altered DNA is injected\ninto the cassava plant. - We bombard the stems\nwith the CRISPR construct, and what happens is the leaves grow up.\n- Ah. In principle, as the leaves and the tubers\ngrow from the stem, the plant will become\nmore resistant to the crippling\nmosaic disease. When can we see\na possible usage in African countries\nthat are afflicted? - We're still trying to hone in\nthat technique. So hopefully,\nwe'll get it soon. - Hopefully soon.\n[laughter] Imagine--gene editing\ncould help end world hunger. - This is also applicable\nbeyond crops to things like trees. Forests may be the biggest\nfarms that we have. - But as\nthe human population grows, so do our agricultural needs. This leads to deforestation, which is one of the primary\ncauses of climate change, contributing to\nthe record high temperatures we see today. To reverse this scary trend, one solution is to plant\nmore trees to absorb greenhouse gases\nlike carbon dioxide. Rodolphe is collaborating with\ntree biologist Dr. Jack Wang to grow more trees, and fast. What do we have here? - So these are\ntransgenic trees. - Jack's lab has created over 10,000 types of\ngenetically modified trees. The goal is to optimize traits\nfor different industries, like timber or paper, to reduce their\nenvironmental footprint. - We deliver CRISPR\ninto these cells. - Once CRISPR has\naltered the tree DNA, the embryos then grow\nenhanced roots and shoots. - so these have been\nengineered precisely for a specific genetic change\nusing CRISPR. - This helps Jack\nto select for specific traits more quickly\nand efficiently than traditional\nplant breeding. - So this little bit\nof seedling is now a tiny little CRISPR-edited\nforest tree species. - This is at the stage just before it goes\ninto the greenhouse? - That's right.\nSo it's now ready to be grown for\nfive to six months. - Fantastic.\nSo cool. Jack's next step is taking these seedlings\nover to the greenhouse where they'll be fully grown\nand studied. - Compared to\n15, 20 years it takes to breed a tree\nin a natural population, in the greenhouse setting,\nwe can analyze and produce new genetically improved trees in as little as\nfive to six months. - That is incredible.\nSix months? Here they're quickly\ngrowing poplar trees, which is the most\neffective species at absorbing carbon dioxide\nfrom the air. - Yeah, they can capture a very large amount of carbon\nfrom the atmosphere, and we have to start solving\nthe problem right here, right now. We cannot afford to wait\nfor another 20 or 30 years. - This technique\nfor breeding trees has given reforestation\nefforts a major jump-start. Our environmental clock\nis ticking, and if we want\nto create a better, healthier environment\nfor future generations, it's something that\nhas to be done now. - What we're doing here is really the beginning\nof a true revolution. The next green revolution,\ncoming to a forest near you. - Yes. - I think it's going to\nrevolutionize our world and solve the grand challenges\nthat we have on the planet. - A new CRISPR-fueled\ngreen revolution will forge a path\nto a more bountiful world. [dramatic music] - In the future,\ngene edited plants are addressing world hunger\nand climate change. Enhanced food crops\ngrow in harsh conditions, even in water-parched deserts. Thanks to these\ndisease-resistant plants, famines across the world\nare a thing of the past. New fast-growing forests\ncollectively take in the excess carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere, cooling the climate\nand restoring balance to the world's ecosystem. [inquisitive music] - As I see it,\ngene editing is both a faster and more precise method\nfor artificial selection. While it works in\nmicrobes and plants, how feasible is gene editing in more biologically complex\norganisms like animals? I'm in Davis, California, to meet geneticist\nAlison Van Eenennaam. She's a pioneer in this field, and I'm getting\nacquainted with her work. Oh, no. - Scientists tend to be\nproblem solvers, and want to try\nand address problems using the best method they can, and my lab is trying to breed\nbetter cattle. - There are about\n1 billion cattle on earth. That's a lot of animals\nto manage, but Alison is making\ncattle farms safer by eliminating\none particular trait. - I see some horns up here.\n- Okay. - Dairy cows have been\nbred to be very optimal\nfor dairy production, and, as it happens,\ndairy cows grow horns. - And these horns\nare a problem because they injure\nother cattle and ranchers. - You can imagine if this was\na particularly aggressive bull, that he could\nhurt his pen mates. - Instead of manually\nsawing off these horns, Alison is breeding a dairy cow that doesn't grow them\nin the first place. Working with a type of cattle\nthat has no horns, she had their hornless gene inserted into horned\ndairy bull cells. These cells were cloned\nto make the hornless animals. These hornless cows\nare descendants of a gene-edited\nhornless bull. - These are\nproof of concept animals. They are kind of a prototype of how you could use\ngenome editing. - This genetic technique\nproduces offspring with a desired trait\nmuch more quickly than the decades of breeding\nnormally required in traditional\nanimal husbandry. - That's really what\nediting does for us, is it enables us to bring in one useful characteristic\nthat we want-- in this case,\nnot growing horns-- and not alter\nthe rest of the genetics. - This technique shows that\ngene editing tools can be used to introduce desirable traits\nfrom one animal into another. [light music] Outside of trying to\nremove the horns, are there any other expressions that you would want to\nget rid of or add? - So what else might we do? One of the targets that's\na really obvious one for plant and animal breeders\nis disease resistance. And so globally it's estimated we lose about 20% of all\nanimal production to disease. - That's a large percent. That's hundreds of millions\nof cattle needlessly lost every year. - To me, genetics is the best\napproach to deal with disease, 'cause if they don't get sick,\nthey don't need to be treated with antibiotics.\nThey're more productive. Farmer's happy, cattle are\nhappy, consumers are happy. So it's kind of a triple win\nfor sustainability. - But there's an even more\nfundamental trait that Alison is\ntrying to select for. - In the beef cattle industry,\nwe would actually prefer males. - That's because male beef\ncattle produce quantitatively more meat per pound of feed\nthan females. So Alison is also using\ngene editing to breed cattle who only produce\nmale offspring. To achieve this,\nshe inserts a special gene into cow embryos in the lab. This makes selecting\nthe male sex possible. This could save more animals\nfrom being slaughtered, and techniques like these could be used to\ninsert disease resistance, potentially reducing\nthe need for antibiotics. In fact, a gene-edited embryo was implanted into this cow\njust three months ago. - And there is Princess. - So in a few short moments, we're about to see\nan ultrasound of a cow here. Veterinarian Bret McNabb is going to perform\nan ultrasound on Princess to see if the gene-edited\nembryo has taken hold. - We're just gonna make sure\nthat the pregnancy is still healthy and viable\nfrom what we can tell. - So an ultrasound on a cow is not quite the same\nas an ultrasound on... [laughter] - The principles are the same, but our approach\nis a little bit different. - Alison's checkup may depend\non the whims of this mama cow to get the ultrasound scanner\nup her... well, you know. [quirky music] \u266a \u266a [cow lows] - [chuckles]\nYou're doing that next time. - You know, I'm learning quite\na bit just observing, so... - Oh, I see.\n[laughter] - She's pregnant.\n- That's good news. - It appears\nthe embryo implant has successfully taken hold. - So on ultrasound, you know,\nwe use sound waves, and so anything\nthat's more dense is gonna bounce the sound\nwave back to my probe. And then you can start to see\nfloating around in there are those bright white\nstructures. Those are all\nparts of the calf. - Oh, yeah.\nOkay. - Based on certain structures, we can sex the calf,\nand it looks like a male. - For Alison's endeavor to\nbreed male-only beef cattle, this is a significant\nmilestone. While these techniques\nare still experimental and haven't yet been\napproved by the FDA, Alison believes that\nconsuming products from gene edited cattle poses\nno threat to human health. Artificially selecting\nfor the male sex could make cattle production more humane\nand more efficient. - There are some\npretty compelling benefits that outweigh the risks. - Seeing the genetic\nengineering of livestock up-close and personal\nis absolutely mind-blowing. [bright music] - In the future, engineering\nthe genes of farm animals speeds up their evolution\nas useful domestic species. A new variety of cow gene\nedited to dramatically reduce the emission of the\nclimate-damaging gas methane is vastly reducing\nglobal warming. Organs from genetically\nmodified pigs are safely implanted\ninto humans without fear of rejection\nfrom the immune system. No one dies from a lack\nof an organ donor anymore. [energetic music] - Humans have selectively\nbred plants and animals, refining their traits,\nfor thousands of years. We've even created hybrids by mating creatures\nfrom two different species. For example, a donkey\nand a horse make a mule. But in the lab,\nmixing up genetics can result in anything\nand, well, everything. Jellyfish DNA\nspliced into a bunny results in\na fluorescent bunny. When spider DNA\nis edited into goats, their milk can be spun\ninto spider silk. Hybrids like these are\noften bioengineered for research purposes. But one scientist is using\nCRISPR's crossbreeding ability to do something\ntruly ambitious. He's bringing back the genes\nof extinct species. I'm in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, to meet Dr. George Church, a legend in\nthe field of genetics, one of the originators\nof gene engineering. He's been working in\nRussian Siberia to find the remains of\nwoolly mammoths with the aim of\nresurrecting their DNA to fight climate change. - There's unfortunately lots of\nmelting ice in Siberia. As there are millions of\nmammoths that are frozen that are becoming exposed, we had access to six really\nexcellently frozen specimens. They had never thawed\nin 40,000 years. - When you were\ngrabbing the samples from the woolly mammoth,\nanatomically where... - We're dissecting\nbig chunks of mammoth legs with a drill bit, and we're kind of suited up because there's meat\nflying all over the place. - Due to overhunting\nand environmental changes, woolly mammoths\nbegan going extinct around 10,000 years ago. But George is\nextracting their DNA from the cold preserved\nremains in Siberia and mapping their genome. - So we read the genome\ninto the computer and then we write it into\nmodern Asian elephant cells. - Modern Asian elephants\nand woolly mammoths share common ancestry,\nbut are two distinct species. George is using advanced\nCRISPR techniques to resurrect multiple cold resistant genes\nfrom the woolly mammoth that grow extra hair\nand produce more fat. He then plans to integrate\nthese genetic traits into the eggs of\nAsian elephants. - We can make dozens of edits\nto the genome and then clone them\ninto baby elephants. - But why? It turns out\ncold-resistant elephants could also help mitigate\nglobal warming. In the frigid tundra\nof Siberia, grass is more effective\nat keeping the Arctic cold than the current\nforced environment, which retains heat. - Those millions of\nsquare kilometers are at risk of warming,\nand the only herbivore that can knock down the trees\nis the elephant. Oddly, the herbivores can\nchange it back to grasslands, which is more photosynthetic. - A sizable population of\ncold-resistant elephants would help maintain\nthis region as grasslands through grazing. And a more\nphotosynthetic Arctic would absorb\nmore carbon dioxide. - So it's part of\nwhat will hopefully be a big international effort\nto convert the Arctic, at least partially,\nback to the form that was more conducive\nto fighting climate change. - Is it outside of the realm\nof possibility to, say, bring back an extinct creature\nlike a woolly mammoth? - Once we get that good at it, we may switch\nthe cold-resistant elephants into fully genetically\nidentical mammoths. - Who knew resurrecting\nwoolly mammoth DNA could help restore icy\nconditions across the Arctic? - In the future,\ngenes from most creatures can be safely inserted\ninto other species to create\nrevolutionary hybrids. Engineered jellyfish\nwith genes from plastic-eating microbes\nnow clean up the oceans by organically breaking down\nnon-decomposing trash. Some scientists have\neven extracted DNA from dinosaur remains\nand are on the brink of resurrecting\nthese extinct species. The hope is by bringing a\nsingle dinosaur back to life, new technologies\nwill be developed to help other species\non the brink of extinction. - Speaking with\nGeorge Church firsthand is both humbling\nand inspiring. As if resurrecting the DNA of the woolly mammoth\nwasn't enough, he also helped start the $3\nbillion Human Genome Project. This landmark study identified\nevery base pair of DNA and mapped the entire\nhuman genome. Its primary purpose\nwas to conquer disease. It was and remains\na really big deal. - We are here\nto celebrate the completion of the first survey\nof the entire human genome. - This roadmap of\nthe intricate genetic codes across the human body empowers doctors to better\ndiagnose and treat disease. - We've worked really hard\non bringing down the costs of reading genomes,\nwhich I think is a thing that most people\ncould benefit from. - Thanks to advances in\nDNA sequencing technology, the cost of reading\nentire genomes has plummeted. - All it would take is\na small tipping point event to shift it over so that\neverybody's using this. And in the case\nof genetics, that would be reading\neverybody's genome and giving them information\nthat was actionable. - By actionable, he means\nletting individuals know what kinds of diseases they're\ngenetically susceptible to. This empowers people\nto be proactive in avoiding or managing\nimminent diseases. - I think\nwe're on a trajectory where everybody in the world\nare gonna get sequenced within a few years. - The Human Genome Project\ncontinues to have a big impact in treating all kinds\nof human diseases. [light dramatic music] To find out how,\nI'm at the historic Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\nin Long Island, New York, to meet with\nDr. Bruce Stillman. - There has been a revolution coming from\nthe Human Genome Project and a lot of cancer research\nis linked to that. We now have a very deep\nunderstanding of that genetics and what that can do is\nto link new therapeutics to individual patient's\ngenetics. - I have an interest\nin oncology. - Mm-hmm. - I lost an aunt\nto breast cancer, and I think that took me\ndown this journey towards finding a solution. - One of our scientists\nused a very interesting genetic technique of\ngenetic selection, and now we're gearing up\nto use that information to improve cancer therapy. - Founded in 1890, this lab is home to\neight Nobel Prize winners. - So this was the first lab at Cold Spring Harbor,\nand still used. This is a cancer laboratory, so still used\nfor cancer research. - Scientists here are using\ngene editing techniques, including CRISPR, to develop\nnew ways to fight cancer. These advances are\nleading to treatments, tailored to work with an\nindividual's unique genetics. - So for instance,\nif you have a mutation in a particular gene\nthat causes lung cancer, there is a therapeutic that is\ntargeted to that lung cancer. - But in the shadow\nof its long history of using genetics\nto improve human life, Cold Spring Harbor Labs do have an unfortunate\nand dark past. - What happened in\nthe 1910s and the 1920s was that scientists\nbegan to believe that a lot of traits were\ninherited by individual genes, when in fact they weren't. - This led to an era of\nwhat's called eugenics-- that is, the selective\nbreeding of humans. Cold Spring Harbor Labs\neven opened a eugenics records office to\ngather biological information on the American population. At the time,\npeople of certain traits that some believed\nto be desirable were deemed fit to reproduce, while minorities and\nthose with disabilities were blocked from marrying\nand were even sterilized. - That eugenics movement\ngot way off track from science. Scientists pushed back against\nthis eugenics movement, and, by the 1930s, it was effectively shut down\nin the United States. - Despite this skeleton\nin the closet, it's important\nto know our history so as not to repeat it. And from what I see at\nCold Spring Harbor Labs today, I think there's plenty of room\nto be optimistic. When real science\nis conducted, true progress can be made. And the best place to start\nis with affected children. - We have worked on a disease\ncalled spinal muscular atrophy, which is a mutation\nthat children inherit. The child will eventually die. But the laboratory\ndeveloped a drug, which actually prevents\nthese children from dying and actually gives them\na fairly high quality of life. - All this makes me think of\nyoung Annabel Frost and her debilitating\ngenetic disorder. And this kind of research\nfills me with hope. In fact, genetic engineering\ncan even remedy genetic disorders\nlike sickle cell anemia. Caused by a mutation, this\ndisease deforms blood cells into hook-like shapes,\nwhich can stick together and cause life-threatening\nblood clots. - CRISPR's now being\nused to change genes in sickle cell anemia, where you then transplant\nback into those patients cells in the blood system that will essentially reverse\nthe sickle cell disease. And so those types of trials\nare occurring now with CRISPR. - Recently,\nscientists gene edited a patient's own stem cells\nthat produce bone marrow. They then reinjected these altered cells\nback into her body. Amazingly, this therapy\ncured the patient's sickle cell disease\nfor the first time in history. - Technologies like CRISPR\nare incredibly powerful and can change the world. They also have the potential for changing humanity\nas itself. - But there are limitations. The CRISPR technology\nis not perfect, and sometimes\nit makes mistakes in the genetic reworking\nthat could be catastrophic. This means CRISPR's\nimplementation directly into humans\nremains a risky prospect. But one visionary scientist\nis aiming to give gene editing\ntechniques an even higher level\nof precision. Dr. David Liu of the Broad\nInstitute of Harvard and MIT is working on tools and\ntechniques that may one day lead to the safe\ngene editing of humans. He's developing a new gene editing tool\ncalled prime editing. Can you tell me a little bit\nabout your work in that regard? - So the machines\nthat nature provides us, like CRISPR-Cas9, often don't do\nwhat we want them to do. The results of breaking\nthat double helix most frequently\ndisrupts things to cause the deletion\nor insertion of small numbers of DNA letters at the cut site. - Both CRISPR and prime\nediting technologies work by cutting DNA. But in some sensitive\nsituations, CRISPR technology can be\ntoo blunt of a tool. That's because it breaks both\nstrands of the double helix. In rare instances,\nthis can disrupt the gene in unintended ways. But prime editing is\nmore like a pair of tweezers. It breaks only one strand\nof the double helix, allowing scientists to\nvery precisely change a single base pair. This is like changing one note\nin a musical score. - For most diseases\nwith a genetic component, it's believed that in order\nto treat the disease, you need to precisely\nchange that mutated gene back to the normal\nDNA sequence. - This ultra-precise technique\nmeans David can replace an individual mutation\non a single step of DNA and not an entire section\nof the ladder. - So you can make those kinds\nof changes using prime editors, the kinds of changes that we\nbelieve could directly correct genetic disease-causing\nmutations. - In the lab, David has\nsuccessfully corrected mutations for\ngenetic diseases, including Tay-Sachs\nand cystic fibrosis. And he thinks this prime\ntechnology will soon be ready to help people with genetic\ndisorders, like Annabel. How far off would you say is\na potential human application? - We should have some\nof the first drugs ready by perhaps as early as within\nthe next five or ten years. It's an incredibly\nexciting time. If you had asked me\nabout five or ten years ago, I would have said it still was in the realm\nof science fiction. - Yeah, that's wonderful. This experimental technique\nwill become science fact, giving affected individuals\nthe prospect of a better life. But for now, reworking the genetic codes of\npeople remains controversial. In 2018,\na researcher stunned the world by using CRISPR\nto gene edit HIV resistance into the embryos\nof a pair of twins. Called germline editing,\nthis technique on humans was considered premature and was widely condemned\nin the scientific community. - The first gene editing\nin humans was a profound\nmisuse of science with profound implications\nin society in general. - The involved parties\nwere punished for disregarding\nsafety regulations. Fortunately or unfortunately,\nthe Pandora's box of genetic engineering\nhas been thrown wide-open. - In many ways, this is one\nof the costs of doing science. The technology itself\nis agnostic. It's neither good nor bad. The real question is,\n\"What do people do \"with that technology and how\ncareful and/or mindful are they to the potential unintended\nconsequences that we have?\" - With the depth of control\nover evolution that gene editing enables in breeding plants, animals,\nand eventually humans, we are entering uncharted\nwaters as a species. It's difficult\nto draw a hard line between where progress\nshould stop and where our morality\nor our ethics should come in. Some might argue that some lines have to be crossed\nto make progress. And there has been\nmuch progress, especially in agriculture. Today, more than 90%\nof corn and soybeans are genetically modified,\nor GMO. These crops require less\npesticide, land, and water. Scientists are also using\ngene editing to develop crops that are more nutritious\nand even drought-resistant. Though many in the public\nremain skeptical, the vast majority of\nscientists believe GMO foods are safe. - Tinkering with genes for\nbenefit and for good purpose is actually\nan ethical thing to do. - And as for humans,\nmany believe the benefits of gene editing\noutweigh the risks. - There are 10,000\nmonogenic diseases affecting hundreds of millions of\nchildren across the world. Precise medicine would help, and then we start\nbuilding on that. - In the right hands,\nI think genetic engineering will usher in\na much better future for people and our planet. Some think it will even shift human evolution\ninto overdrive. - In 30 years,\nwe may be unrecognizable. I don't think that's\ngoing to be our intention, but when you take\nthese big leaps and get comfortable with them,\npeople get addicted. - I'm hopeful that\ngene editing technology will ultimately help people\nlike my aunt and Annabel and, for those reasons\nand many more, I believe the rise of\ngenetic engineering can't come fast enough.",

        "Transcript": "I do not call any place home. I travel one hundred percent of my time. I don't own an apartment. I usually sleep\nabout four or five hours a day. I don't have a family\nand Insilico is my life. My name is Alex Zhavoronkov and I am the founder and CEO\nof a company called Insilico Medicine. I specialise in AI-powered drug discovery, so developing\nartificial intelligence solutions to accelerate the way drugs\nare discovered and developed. Around 2013, 2014,\ndeep neural networks became so powerful that they started outperforming humans\nin image recognition text recognition\nand many other human tasks. The public perceives AI\nas something magical and something that may replace\nhuman intelligence in daily tasks. It's actually not far from the truth, but what AI really is\nis mathematics and neuroscience. To me, AI represents hope. To us, AI is a tool which allows us\nto go into drug discovery much faster, go after much more challenging\nbiological and chemical problems with higher confidence, and reduce the risk in drug discovery and also increase the probability\nof success in clinical trials. The pharmaceutical industry\nis extremely risky. It takes decades to develop a new drug\nand bring it to the market, and you fail more often than you succeed. So, you really need to be the true\nmixed martial arts fighter in pharma in order to succeed. What we have done at Insilico so far, we've demonstrated that we can go\nfrom disease hypothesis all the way into clinical trials, with very high probability of success. So, we actually validated our AI\nutilising our own therapeutic programmes, going end-to-end from the very risky part where we discover and uncover\nand validate novel targets, all the way to generating\nour own novel chemistry with the desired properties. And we've managed to do it\nat a fraction of the cost and time. Most of the companies in our field started experimenting with\nend-to-end systems around 2019, 2020, so it has really been\nonly two or three years. So, we started utilising\nthe same technology to generate novel molecular structures\nwith the desired molecular properties to prosecute those biological targets\nthat we identify using a different form of AI. On the 14th, we are releasing\nour Pharma.AI update. The future is much better than you think,\nand also much faster. AI will definitely de-risk, democratise\nand enable new entrants, including younger countries who have never\nhad any experience in drug discovery, to get into biotech, to join the community\nand to start innovating from the get-go. I believe that in 20 years, we are likely to see AI systems\ngoing after personalised drug discovery, where drugs will be tailored\ntowards a specific individual.",

        "Transcript": "- [Narrator] This is Arne Duncan, the Secretary of Education for seven years during the Obama administration. And this is Oklahoma State\nSchools Superintendent Ryan Walters, who supports President-elect\nDonald Trump's plan to abolish the Department of Education. - I'm gonna close the\nDepartment of Education and move education back to the states. And we're gonna do it fast. - President-elect Trump will not eliminate the Department of Education, and this will be just another\nunfulfilled campaign promise, like getting Mexico to build a wall. - Look, President Trump has\nlaid out the most aggressive, boldest, most conservative\nreform agenda for education this nation's history. - This weaponization of the\nfederal Department of Education will just be disastrous. - [Narrator] So why do\nTrump and some Republicans want to dismantle the\nDepartment of Education? And what would that look like? - I think all those federal employees are gonna be fired from their jobs. We're gonna do away with the agency. That building needs to go away. It needs to be something else. - [Narrator] The US\nDepartment of Education, the smallest of the\ncabinet-level agencies, has more than 4,400 employees\nand a budget of $79 billion. - Education is mostly a\nstate and local issue. But what the Department of Education does is pretty important. - [Narrator] The Department\nhandles Title I funding for high poverty K-12 schools and IDEA funding for\nstudents with disabilities. At the higher ed level, it distributes federal student aid, including loans and Pell Grants. The Office for Civil Rights\nenforces laws like Title IX, protecting against\ngender-based discrimination. - It's fighting for equity,\na focus on excellence, and really driving and scaling innovation. Those are three roles that I\nthink are critically important. - [Narrator] Duncan is now\nthe leader of Chicago CRED, a nonprofit working to\nreduce gun violence. - Let's take IDEA very specifically, children with special needs. As you know, historically, those children were actually denied access to going to public schools. And it took the federal\ngovernment to come in and provide access to\nchildren with special needs. There are over 7.5 million\nchildren with special needs that receive billions of\ndollars of additional funding from the US Department of Education. And guess what? You want\naccountability for those resources. - [Narrator] Superintendent Walters says school accountability should shift from the federal government to parents. - There's nobody who\nloves their child more or who cares more about their\nchild than their mom and dad. So the more that we empower\nthem through school choice, through transparency and\naccountability measures, what you're gonna see is all\nschools are gonna get better. - [Narrator] Trump faces an uphill battle to abolish the Department of Education. It would take an act of Congress\nto dismantle the department or to get rid of any of the programs written into federal law. - I sometimes think of this\nas two different scenarios. A soft abolish would be\ngetting rid of the department but keeping its various programs and then just sort of\nredistributing the programs to other federal agencies. A hard abolish would be\ngetting rid of the department and many or all of its programs. That might be a much tougher\nsled through Congress and might be a lot more controversial. - This is not a political winner, and they have to be very, very careful. You can lie to parents\nabout a lot of things and maybe get away with it, but if you start hurting their children and you start hurting the children who are already vulnerable, there's gonna be hell to pay politically. - [Narrator] The Conservative\nHeritage Foundation's Project 2025, which Trump has repeatedly\ndistanced himself from, has proposed phasing out Title I funding for low-income students over 10 years and converting other programs to no-strings-attached\nformula block grants. - President Trump's plan that money could go directly to families to direct those funds. So what you'll see are states\nhave more power to innovate, states have more power to\nsolve their solutions locally, and then frankly, something we\nalready do here in Oklahoma. States have more power to\nthen give power to families, to parents - [Narrator] Like President-elect Trump, Walters favor school choice programs, generally meaning funding or scholarships for non-traditional\npublic or private schools. - Critics of school choice basically say it will hurt public schools and drain money from public education. In the most recent election,\nthere were three states that had some measure of\nschool choice on the ballot. And in all three states, including in very red\nKentucky and Nebraska, voters voted against\nexpanding school choice. - [Narrator] Aside from dismantling the Department of Education, Trump has signaled he may\nroll back what he calls the radical left agenda. - We will cut federal funding\nfor any school or program pushing critical race\ntheory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial,\nsexual, or political content onto our children. - They take any three-letter\nacronym, DEI, CRT, and try and weaponize it. And so much of what they do is they create these false boogeyman and try and create fear. - [Narrator] Earlier this year, the Biden administration\nextended Title IX protections for transgender students. - They said boys had to be\nallowed in the girls' bathrooms and boys had to be\nallowed in girls' sports or they would take the\nfunding from us, number one, but number two, that they\nwould come after us legally. - [Narrator] The Supreme\nCourt and lower federal courts have halted the Biden administration\nrule change to Title IX in a number of states. President-elect Trump\nhas also signaled support for religion in schools, including prayer in the classroom. In Oklahoma, Superintendent\nWalters mandated that schools share a video\nin which he announces an Office of Religious\nLiberty and Patriotism and prays for Trump. - I pray in particular\nfor President Donald Trump and his team as they continue to bring\nabout change to the country. We wanted our teachers\nand our students to know we will protect your right to exercise your religious beliefs. - [Narrator] At least seven\nOklahoma school districts have said they will not\nshow the video to students. The state's attorney general said the directive for\nschools to show the video was, quote, \"unenforceable.\" - Today we purchased over 500 Bibles that will be in the AP\ngovernment classrooms across the state. Bible just like this. - [Narrator] The same Bible\nendorsed by Donald Trump and selling for $60 per copy. - We must make America pray again. - Trump is a very, very\neasy guy to figure out. You praise him, you ingratiate\nhim, and you give him money. And what you're seeing is lots of folks, including the superintendent of Oklahoma, ingratiate themselves and\nactually use taxpayer money to buy Trump Bibles, which is sort of stunning to me. - So what we wanted was a document that had everything in there. So that's the Bible, the\nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence. So the Bible we purchased had all of them. In Oklahoma, we're gonna continue to lead behind President Trump and make sure that his agenda is enacted. - If all you have is people who are, you\nknow, political hacks who are trying to, you know, weaponize and politicize education\nfor political gain, we're gonna do a grave disservice\nto our country's families, to our country's children, and to our nation's economy. - [Narrator] Whether Trump pushes through on abolishing the Department of Education may come down to how much pushback he gets from a GOP-controlled Congress.

        "Transcript": "you're known at your workplace for being the best at your job you probably have scored the highest marks in your college but it means so little if you don't have the skills that you need what i mean here is do you have the skill of teamwork some of the most important professional skills can't really be taught in the classroom and these skills are called soft skills and they're more crucial to get you recruited than you think so what are soft skills well unlike hard skills these skills cannot be measured but they can be proved so some examples of soft skills include verbal and written communication teamwork and leadership so one reason that soft skills are so important is that they are the key to building relationships gaining reputation and creating more opportunities for you to develop your relationships so today i'm going to tell you what are some crucial soft skills to get you hired or to accelerate your career growth this is michelle and you're watching me on skillopedia the place to develop skills for the real world now the first crucial skill to take your career to the next level is communication let me explain this further let's look at why we need communication so both written and verbal communication skills are very important in the workplace because a they help you create a positive image second they improve your chances of building relationships with your co-workers and c communication skills boost your performance so whether it's at your workplace or in your college or in your department you are going to boost your performance if your communication is strong now let's look at why employers look for the skill so of course workers are more productive when they know how to communicate with each other it's very simple if you can clearly express the who what when why where and how of a project you'll be a hot ticket which means you'll be much in demand so this is my suggestion you must develop your verbal and written communication but you must be thinking what are the ways to do that so now i'm going to suggest to you some tips to gain this crucial skill so the first thing that you can do is you can probably join a public speaking workshop where you get an opportunity to speak publicly and gain your confidence you could also do this by watching some of our videos about public speaking at schidopedia and try to imitate those and learn the tips from there and apply them when you're speaking in public okay the second thing that you could do is apart from speaking you also need to be an active listener so active listening is when you wait until the other person has finished speaking and really listen to what they are saying before you jump in so this is a very important and often overlooked skill of communication so i'd suggest that you listen carefully and try public speaking workshops but that's not it lastly you can also learn to monitor your body language which means to develop your ability to communicate non-verbally so this can mean maintaining good eye contact while talking nodding while you're listening and a firm handshake when you're leaving so these are just some examples of body language you can again watch some of our videos on body language to understand how you can improve this to improve your overall communication skills now the other crucial skill to take your career to the next level is teamwork so why do you need teamwork well you need it because no one person doing everything by himself or herself can make a project successful so success is obviously the result of many people working together to achieve a common goal so therefore when employers want to hire employees they really look for the skill of teamwork the reason for this is because good teamwork spirit improves the culture of the office and it improves the office environment due to which many people stay in the organization and top talent comes to them so now we know that teamwork is a very important skill to take your career to the next level but what are the ways to gain the skill so the first thing that you could do is lend a hand which means to help someone when you see a friend or a classmate or a co-worker in need so you could offer help by saying hey i know you have a ton on your plate how can i help this small gesture can help you a lot to develop your team spirit skills okay the next one would be to say it would be another way to build the skill is by offering a cover for a colleague which means that if someone's on a vacation and you need to cover for them before they ask you it's better that you go up to them and say hey it looks like you've be you're going on an annual leave well have fun but do you need help with your cover great so this way you can display your spirit of teamwork and the third way of being a team player is to take responsibility for your actions so that means whenever you've made a mistake rather than putting the blame on someone else you should accept it and say that yes i did it and this is a very good point to be a good team worker so these are my three tips for you to gain the skill of team spirit in order to take your career to the next level now the next crucial skill to escalate your career is adaptability so adaptability means the ability to adapt which i think simply means to be flexible so now the question is why do you need to be flexible so it's because things don't always go as planned isn't it when you plan something it doesn't always work so the better thing is instead of grumbling and complaining about how things are not turning up as you wanted the best thing is to find alternate solutions and this is what good leaders do they find solutions to problems and not increase the problem so why do employ employers look for this skill well it's because the speed of change in any organization is so fast that employees need to adapt to the changes in the organization so well the way to gain this skill is to push yourself that's how you can be flexible and you can adapt to the changes so to be an early adopter of change for example um adapting to technology without mourning is crucial so people can see you as someone who is capable of meeting new challenges or if you're in your college another way would be to attend training sessions to learn new things about your area of study so you can display that you are quick to learn and you love to be flexible and adapt new changes so this is how you can develop the third skill which i have spoken to you about today which is adaptability now another critical skill for your career is problem solving so the reason you need this skill is because when something goes wrong you can either complain about it or take action and of course it's taking action that will get you noticed so knowing how to think on your feet which means to think of quick solutions or to make decisions very quickly this is a very important skill when it comes to being an important part of an organization so when employ why do employees look for it the reason for this is very simple because companies face many problems every day and they need solvers and these solvers aka their top performance their performers help them to sail through unexpected challenges so the best way to gain this skill is to always approach your boss with a solution not a problem this is how you become a pro problem solver so when an issue arises sit down and think through how you're going to solve it before bringing it to your boss's attention and he will definitely appreciate your effort to solve the problem even before bringing it our final skill that i'm going to discuss with you to take your career to the next level is critical thinking so why do you need this skill well critical thinking is essential to bring new ideas in the workplace critical thinking means to think about the positives and the negatives of every idea and employees need to be able to think about this to be better problem solvers as we discussed in the previous step and this skill will make you successful no matter what your job is so now how to develop your critical thinking skills well i think the only way to develop it is by learning so find ways to learn you could read the news every day you could read books you could discuss non-work issue with your friends and family members the reason you could do this is to generate ideas because when you discuss problems with others you're able to brainstorm new ideas and this will help your critical thinking processes so this brings us to the end of our session and today you have learned the top skills that can take your career to the next level so try to use these strategies that i've shared with you and tell me how these strategies have helped you this is how you gain soft skills so let me know what you felt about this session in your comments and which of these skills is most relevant to you thank you so much for staying with me till the very end of this session i'll see you very soon with another useful session till then keep developing your soft skills you",

However, bringing technology into\nthe classroom in a productive way is easier said than done. Welcome to 11.133X-- Implementation and\nEvaluation of Educational Technology, the fourth of the Ed\nTech X course series. This course provides\na practical overview for selecting,\nintegrating, implementing, and evaluating educational\ntechnology initiatives in formal educational settings,\nprimarily in the United States. We'll include the\nperspectives of stakeholders that makes such initiatives\npossible, and consider how to evaluate for efficacy. The target audience for this course\nincludes current and future teachers, entrepreneurs,\ndevelopers, practitioners, and leaders in educational technology. Through four units over\nseven weeks, participants will develop an awareness\nand understanding of the ecosystem surrounding\nthe implementation of educational technology. How do educators and others\ndecide what educational technology to use in the classroom? Which stakeholders\ninfluence that decision?

        "Transcript": "It's 841 right now. Time for help wanted. Wednesday, new workforce numbers for Colorado show a new trend when it comes to job openings and unemployed workers. Our Nine News legal analyst Whitney Trailer joins us about this trend. So Whitney, what are you seeing in the latest numbers? Good morning, Cory. In Colorado, actually the data is showing that there's about two job openings for every unemployed worker. But employers are cautious because they've been pausing hires or even laying off staff because of inflation and other reasons. Well, some are suggesting that the labor crisis can be ended by actually utilizing older workers. Colorado's population, as we know, is getting older each year. And next year, Cory, there's going to be the number of people over 60 are going to outnumber those who are under 18 in Colorado. So employers should consider some of these older workers to fill these positions because the scholarship shows there's real benefits in hiring these older workers. And of course, it's illegal. It's unlawful to. Not hire those folks under the age discrimination in Employment Act. So we want also comply with the law. You calling me an older worker, huh? Huh, I'm not. So what are some of the unique opportunities that you have to highlight today? Right, so there's a few. So the state is actually offering a Google career certificate. So they got funding for 500 people to get trained in a a bunch of fields, technical fields like data analytics and digital marketing and things like that. The training is 3 to six months. Part time, no experience required, and they pay, so that's a beautiful opportunity if you're looking for something different. Second, there is a job fair tomorrow with 50 employers. It's between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM at Tivoli Honoraria campus, my former school, MSU Denver, and it's hosted by them as well as the Society for Hispanic Human Resource Professionals. So it's on our website. It's on their website, so check out those. Unique opportunities. Good opportunities there. And real quick, you do have a shout out. I have a special shout out. Thanks, Corey. Today is my mother's birthday, so give me a shout out to Rita. I won't say what number, but she looks great. Yeah. And have a great day and I'll see you soon. Good call. 29 forever. Right.

        "Transcript": "Have you ever wondered how many ways there are to learn online, and which platform is the best fit for you?\" We're about to embark on a journey through the vast expanse of online learning platforms, from Massive Open Online Courses like Coursera and edX to Learning Management Systems such as Moodle and Blackboard. And let's not forget about specialized platforms like Skillshare and Masterclass. Each has its unique flavor and potential to ignite your learning journey. \"Let's get into the diverse world of online learning platforms and discover what each has to offer. Welcome back to Uninterrupted Learning, where limitless knowledge awaits! Ready to elevate your skills? Like, subscribe, and join our community for a seamless journey into a world of continuous education. Let's learn, grow, and thrive together! Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, are a popular choice for lifelong learners. But how do Coursera,  edX,  Khan Academy,  and Udemy stand out?\" Well, let's start with Coursera. Picture this: a virtual classroom where you can learn from  world-renowned universities and institutions. That's Coursera for you. It offers a wide array of courses, from humanities to data science, and even includes professional certificates and degrees. However, the trade-off might be the cost, as some of these advanced courses can be pricey. Next up, we have edX. Founded by Harvard and MIT, edX is all about quality. Like Coursera, edX offers a variety of courses, but with a heavier focus on science  and technology. It's a great platform if you're looking for in-depth, academic knowledge. On the flip side, the rigorous coursework might be a challenge for some. Now, let's talk about Khan Academy. If you're looking for free education, Khan Academy is your go-to. It's a non-profit platform with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere. It's especially known for its strong foundation courses in math  and science. The downside? It might not offer the breadth of courses you'd find on Coursera or edX. Last but not least, we have Udemy. Udemy is like a bustling marketplace of knowledge, with courses on practically anything you can think of, taught by anyone willing to share their expertise. From coding to cooking, Udemy has it all. The catch? The quality of courses can vary, as there's no centralized quality control like in Coursera or edX. In a nutshell, Coursera is your virtual university, edX is your academic powerhouse, Khan Academy is your free educational resource, and Udemy is your knowledge marketplace. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on what you're looking for in your learning journey. \"MOOCs offer a broad range of courses, but what if you're looking for a more structured learning environment?\" Learning Management Systems, or LMS, offer a more structured learning environment. But how do Moodle, Blackboard Learn, Canvas, and Talent LMS differ?\" Let's dive into the details. Moodle, a free, open-source platform, is known for its flexibility. It's like a Lego set for online learning - you can build it, shape it, and customize it to your heart's content. Its extensive library of plugins allows for a tailored learning experience, but with great power comes great responsibility. This flexibility means you might need some technical know-how to truly make the most of Moodle. Next up, we have Blackboard Learn. This heavyweight in the education sector is known for its robust feature set and comprehensive integration capabilities. It's like the Swiss army knife of LMSs. But, be warned, with such an array of tools, the learning curve can be steep. Now, let's talk about Canvas. Canvas is a breath of fresh air with its intuitive, user-friendly design. It's like the Apple of LMS. It focuses on making the learning experience as smooth as possible. However, while simplicity is its strength, some may find it lacks the depth of features found in Moodle or Blackboard. Lastly, we have Talent LMS. Talent LMS is like a friendly tutor, aiming to make online learning as easy and accessible as possible. It's a cloud-based platform, so you can learn anywhere, anytime. It's designed with businesses in mind, making it a perfect match for corporate training. But, on the downside, it might not be the best fit for a traditional education setting. So, there you have it. Four LMSs, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. Moodle offers flexibility, Blackboard provides a comprehensive toolset, Canvas prioritizes ease of use, and Talent LMS focuses on accessibility and corporate training. Remember, the best LMS for you depends on your specific needs, goals, and technical expertise. It's like choosing the right car - you have to pick the one that suits your journey. \"While LMSs deliver a more controlled learning experience, what if you're after a more specialized skill set? Specialized learning platforms offer a unique focus on specific skill sets. But what makes Skillshare, Udacity, Codecademy, and Masterclass stand out?\" Let's dive into it. Starting with Skillshare, a platform that boasts an arsenal of creative courses. From graphic design  to creative writing,  Skillshare acts as a playground for the creatively inclined. It's a platform where learning is not just about absorbing knowledge, but about creating and sharing. However, if you're someone who's more into structured, academic courses, Skillshare might not be your cup of tea. Next, we have Udacity. A platform that prides itself on offering 'nanodegree' programs in tech-related fields. Want to become a data analyst? Or perhaps a self-driving car engineer? Udacity has you covered. The programs are comprehensive, with real-world projects  and mentor support. However, these programs don't come cheap, and they require a significant time commitment. Then there's Codecademy. As the name suggests, this platform is all about coding. Whether you're a coding newbie or an experienced programmer looking to learn a new language, Codecademy provides an interactive learning experience. The hands-on approach is excellent for practical learning, but if you prefer traditional, lecture-based learning, you may find Codecademy's approach a bit too hands-on. And finally, we have Masterclass. This platform takes a different approach, offering classes taught by celebrities and industry leaders. Want to learn acting from Natalie Portman? Or cooking from Gordon Ramsay? Masterclass is where it's at. However, the courses are more inspirational and less technical. It's a platform for gaining insights and inspiration from the best in the business, rather than for detailed, technical learning. In essence, each of these platforms has its unique strengths. Skillshare is great for creative exploration, Udacity for industry-specific tech skills, Codecademy for hands-on coding experience, and Masterclass for learning from industry leaders. But they also have potential drawbacks, depending on your learning style and goals. \"Specialized learning platforms allow for focused skill development, but how do all these platforms compare overall?\" From MOOCs to LMSs to specialized platforms, the digital learning landscape is vast and diverse. We've journeyed through the expansive terrain of Coursera, edX, Khan Academy, and Udemy, the comprehensive LMSs like Moodle, Blackboard Learn, Canvas, and Talent LMS, and the niche spaces of Skillshare, Udacity, Codecademy, and Masterclass. Each with their distinct features and benefits, they pave the way for a myriad of learning opportunities. Remember, the best platform for you depends on your unique learning needs and goals. So explore, experiment, and embrace the power of online learning. Ready to dive into continuous education? Like, subscribe, and be part of Uninterrupted Learning's vibrant community.

        "Transcript": "It\u2019s 2016, happy new year! and welcome back to another Ten with Ken. I\u2019m Ken Steele. A year ago we launched this higher education podcast with a 3 part \u201cyear in review\u201d series. As we launch our second year, we\u2019re going to spend a few episodes looking back at some big picture trends, PR headaches, and notable brand campaigns that impacted North American higher education last year. This week, let\u2019s start counting down the Top Ten Trends of 2015, from equity and politics, to new technologies and new business models. [Music] 2015 was a pretty tough year. France reeled from terrorist attacks in Paris from January to November. America saw extreme drought in California, and flash flooding in Texas. The world saw devastating earthquakes in Nepal, and refugee crises in Europe and Syria. We lost Leonard Nimoy and Yogi Berra, and we lost confidence in Volkswagen over the emissions scandal. We saw the rise of macho right-wing politicians from Vladimir Putin to Donald Trump. But of course, 2015 wasn\u2019t all bad. We didn\u2019t just see 50 Shades of Grey in theatres, but also the Dark Side vanquished by the Light. We got up close and personal with super moons and dwarf planets, saw the launch of the Apple Watch and the safe landing of the SpaceX rocket. We celebrated \u201cBack to the Future\u201d day, Lexus released an actual hoverboard (sort of), and Nike produced limited edition self-lacing shoes. And in Canada at least, we saw a clear shift leftward politically, from the surprise landslide victories of Rachel Notley\u2019s NDP in Alberta, to Dwight Ball\u2019s Liberals in Newfoundland, to Canada\u2019s second Prime Minister Trudeau. Of course, in politics, entertainment, technology, and science we kind of expect to see constant change. But in higher ed, where traditions stretch back centuries and innovation can take decades, did we really see that much change? Here are 10 things that I think signal real trends for higher ed, that we saw either arise last year, or gain momentum. Some themes we covered in previous podcasts, and some we\u2019re going to want to look at in more depth soon. Let\u2019s start with #10\u2026  Gender Equity. I\u2019m ranking this trend last, but certainly not least, because it\u2019s been obvious for decades, and in fact we covered it in depth in episode 6 last May. We saw plenty, good and bad, related to gender equity in 2015. British princesses won the right of succession to the monarchy, and Disney princesses evolved into tough, independent, competent heroines. York\u2019s Lassonde School of Engineering launched the 50:50 Challenge. McMaster and McGill announced multi-million-dollar pay equity settlements. On the other hand, we also saw too much research last year demonstrating that sexism still persists in the academy. Student reviews on RateMyProfessor are more likely to comment on the intellect of male faculty members, or to call female faculty bossy or frumpy. Two top female scientists withdrew from Canada\u2019s Science and Engineering Hall of Fame selection committee to protest the complete lack of female nominees for the second year in a row. We saw atrocious examples of sexist behaviour on social media, coming from students and senior faculty members alike. Ontario University students launched an awareness campaign for what they called the \u201cBachelorette Degree,\u201d to highlight the persistent wage gap for female graduates. Narrator: \"You've heard of a bachelors degree. Every year, thousands are awarded to hard-working students from universities all across Ontario. But what if we told you that over half of our graduates are earning something a little different? Introducing Ontario\u2019s new Bachelorette Degree.\" Female student: \"When I first found out about the Bachelorette Degree, I was like, hmm... I don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s for me. I mean, I have to pay the same tuition as men, but then I get paid $300,000 less over the course of my career? How does that even make sense? But then I found out it actually wasn\u2019t my choice, so\u2026 [music stops] yes.\u201d Narrator: \"Love a good discount? Great! In today\u2019s society, your earning potential is on sale as well.\" Graduate: \u201cMmm. Smells like lavender, and inequality.\u201d Jason: \u201cHey, this sounds fun! Can I get a Bachelorette degree?\u201d Female student: \u201cSilly Jason, income inequality is for women graduates only!\u201d Narrator: \"It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s flirty, it\u2019s feminine. \nIt\u2019ll earn you\u2026 30% less.\" Even though female students are now the majority in most program areas, schools of Engineering and Business remain dominated by males. In the senior faculty ranks, we\u2019re a long way from gender equity across the board. It is not over yet! I\u2019d say top trend #9 for 2015 was\u2026 open textbooks. Textbook publishers have been moving toward electronic platforms for years, and we dedicated an episode to the subject back in September. eTexts are on the rise. Schools like Olds College are providing students with ipads, and at Algonquin College, 100% of students now have access to electronic textbooks at no additional cost. But in 2015 we saw a real growth in momentum for open textbooks in particular. The State of California started things rolling in late 2012, committing to create free, open-source textbooks for the 50 largest college courses in the state. A month later, BC followed suit, committing $1 million to create peer-reviewed open texts for 40 post-secondary courses. In early 2015, at the Open Textbook Summit in Vancouver, we heard that so-called \u201cTextbook Zero\u201d programs can reduce student attrition by up to 10%, simply because the student has the required textbook. By fall, BC Campus had more than 100 open texts available. The government of Manitoba announced its own Open Textbook Initiative, basically to review and adapt the BC Campus texts for use in Manitoba. In October, the Affordable College Textbook Act was reintroduced in the US Congress, to fund the development and adoption of more open textbooks. That\u2019s a lot of momentum for open textbooks in a single calendar year, and I\u2019m beginning to feel optimistic that governments are going to start spending a little more money, to save students a whole lot. Top trend #8 of 2015: protests over the plight of adjunct and contingent faculty. We dedicated a segment to the topic back in July.  Check it out for more details. No question, institutions face growing budget pressure as state and provincial funding dries up. Lecture halls have grown about as much as they can, and it doesn\u2019t look like MOOCs will replace course sections anytime soon. Over the last decade, the solution has been to flood the market with PhD graduates, and to offer them starvation-level wages to teach courses without job security or benefits. In the US, the plight of this \u201cnew faculty majority\u201d has become blatantly obvious. Last spring, adjunct professors joined fast food workers on the picket line to fight for a $15 minimum wage. In Canada, the situation is marginally better, but adjuncts still get paid less than a third of their full-time counterparts to teach the same course. Striking sessional instructors at York University drove national headlines last spring, but the problem is far from resolved. It\u2019s just not sustainable, in the long term, for academia to balance its budget on the backs of young instructors. And the issue rose to public awareness last year. On a lighter note, top trend #7: \n[Mechanical voice] the rise of the machines. Not deadly terminators or transformers \n\u2013 at least not yet. Drones hit the mainstream in 2015, and were being pilot tested for everything from Amazon delivery to Domino\u2019s pizza. An estimated 4.3 million drones were sold worldwide in 2015, and they were expected to be the #1 Christmas gift last month. I didn\u2019t get one! In China, high schools started using drones to patrol college entrance exams, monitoring for digital cheating. Drones started popping up in academic programs and curriculum too, from firefighting and agriculture to filmmaking and journalism. But we\u2019re just starting to see the impact of drones on labour markets and academic programs. Where drones really conquered last year, was in college and university marketing departments. Aerial drone footage was appearing everywhere. \nFrom Oxford University to Holland College, everybody's been showing off their manicured lawns \nand ugly rooftops. MIT Admissions joked that acceptance letters \nwould be arriving by drone. [Music: Ride of the Valkyries] If your marketing department doesn\u2019t have a drone yet, \nit will soon. And I bet budgets for rooftop beautification \nwill increase, as well. In 2015 we also saw signs of change coming to\u2026 traditional academic journals. A few immensely powerful publishers have a chokehold on scholarly publication. A study published last June demonstrated that in the Social Sciences, for example, just 5 corporations control 70% of scholarly output. And since publications are critical for university rankings, tenure and promotion committees, and research grant awards, that means those corporations are the de facto \u201cpower brokers\u201d for academic careers. They haven\u2019t been shy about exploiting their monopoly, either. Some journal subscription fees have been doubling, while costs of electronic production are plummeting. Publishers like Elsevier have been posting 39% profit margins \u2013 healthier even than high tech giant Apple! The Huffington Post declared academic journals \u201cthe most profitable obsolete technology in history.\u201d In 2014, McGill and Brock (among others) cancelled subscriptions to thousands of journals because of rising prices. Even Harvard, with its $40-billion endowment, declared it could no longer afford some journals. When open access negotiations broke down last summer, universities in the Netherlands urged faculty to boycott Elsevier publications, to resign as editors and peer reviewers, and to stop publishing in their journals. Last November, the editors and editorial board of Elsevier\u2019s linguistics publication, Lingua, did just that. Journals have maintained their monopoly because of the credibility of peer review, but even that became contentious last year. An editor at open-access journal Scientific Reports resigned last spring in protest over a new policy that asked authors to pay a premium to expedite the peer review of their articles. Last May, an anonymous peer reviewer created a media firestorm with a sexist remark on a paper. And we saw peer review fraud, peer review rings, and hundreds of articles retracted because of faked peer reviews. Journals\u2019 choke-hold on scholarship makes no sense \nin the internet age. It\u2019s hardly fair that universities must pay billions of dollars a year to rent the right to read their own scholarship. I think a landslide change is inevitable, even if right now all we\u2019re feeling is a few tremors. In 2015 there was also a groundswell of protest against\u2026 generous executive pensions and administrative leaves. A year ago, my list of the biggest higher ed headaches of 2014 included questionable expense accounts at Red River College, and attempts to circumvent government salary caps at VIU, Kwantlen, and Capilano Universities. In 2015, the outrage of faculty, unions and the public seemed focused specifically on some high-profile cases of \u201cdouble-dipping\u201d salaries, when university presidents (and it was all university presidents) took double pay in lieu of a sabbatical year, or received multiple pensions simultaneously. The most prominent case came to light last April, when Ontario\u2019s sunshine list of public sector salaries revealed that Western University president, Amit Chakma, had received $967,000 in 2014 -- more than double his annual salary! Now, technically Chakma had done nothing wrong, but the almost million-dollar paycheque ignited a firestorm, including a non-confidence motion in Senate, a fact-finding investigation, and eventually the resignation of the board chair who signed the contract. Chakma returned half the money, but the university paid almost $100,000 to lawyers and PR consultants. Last May, Quebec\u2019s education minister challenged the $622,000 departure bonus in the contract of Michael Goldbloom, principal of Bishop\u2019s University. Goldbloom promised to forgo half of the severance pay. When UBC president Arvind Gupta resigned abruptly last summer, after just one year on the job, it was revealed that he would receive an extra year\u2019s pay, about $450,000. Last November, McGill University union leaders objected to the supplementary pension being paid to former principal Heather Munroe-Blum, a $284,000 top-up to her $87,000 pensions from McGill and UofT. And in Nova Scotia, we saw controversy over $1.3 million being paid to Tom Traves, former president at Dalhousie University, who continued receiving his salary for 3 years after retirement. Likewise former StFX president Sean Riley received more than $1.2 million for unused administrative leave, which the faculty union called \u201cegregious.\u201d In September, the Nova Scotia Minister of Advanced Education told university board chairs that generous post-retirement salaries are no longer acceptable in a time of rising student costs. When budgets get tight and a scarcity mentality sets in, everyone is looking for a scapegoat, and presidents are a tempting target. I\u2019m quite sure we will continue to see controversies over executive compensation in the years ahead, but boards will probably shy away from contracts that permit \u201cdouble-dipping.\u201d Well, thanks again for taking ten with me. That brings us about halfway through our review of the biggest higher ed trends in 2015. We\u2019ve looked quickly at a few themes from previous episodes, like Gender Equity, Open Textbooks, and Contingent Faculty. We also looked at the rise of Drones, and the evolution of Academic Journals, which probably deserve a closer look sometime. And we looked at the backlash against Double-Dip salaries, a topic we\u2019ll revisit when we sum up the biggest higher ed headaches of 2015. Next time, we\u2019ll finish our countdown with the 4 biggest trends affecting higher ed in 2015, from political correctness to major demographic shifts. I hope you\u2019ll join us!

        "Transcript": "according to study after study working from home leads to more efficient workers less staff turnover higher quality work and it's cheaper for the business and its workers so why the do so many companies want people back into the office the days of working from home are fading for more employees now being called back to the office before covid-19 high-tech companies were already experimenting with the advantages of remote work a peer-reviewed report from an unidentified NASDAQ listed company ran a trial where half of their call center workforce was randomly selected to work from home and the other half would remain in the office the group given the opportunity to work from home had higher customer satisfaction took 13 more calls and suffered 50 percent less staff attrition which is a big issue for call centers which typically struggle with high staff turnover a follow-up study done on workers in a wider selection of roles including Finance marketing and software development had similar results they compared staff working full-time from the office with staff working hybrid schedules from home and the office that study found that hybrid workers were eight percent more efficient at their jobs and had turnover rates 35 percent lower than staff working in the office full-time if businesses want to get the most out of their workers the results are clear more work from home is more better working from home is also cheaper for the business companies that want all of their workers in the office will pay more for utilities like electricity maintenance security and internet that workers would happily provide themselves if they were allowed to work from home it's rare that companies turn down better results for less money but in this case there are four reasons that more are demanding their staff come back into the office the first reason is that a lot of companies are not doing so well right now interest rates are high investors are not throwing money around like they were in 2020 and companies need to make cuts the easiest and largest ongoing expense for most companies are their employees if a business is getting less work than usual laying off staff is a prudent business decision if a business can cut expenses at the same rate as lost Revenue then it may be able to maintain profits to keep the shareholders happy if a business is making less Revenue then it also means there's less work to do so it just won't need as many staff the problem is that laying off staff signals to the market that the company is struggling which can affect the share price make it harder to generate new business this and make it harder to hire new staff in the future nobody wants to work for a company that lays off a lot of people on a whim and customers don't want to work with a company that looks like it might go out of business what companies really need is a way to get rid of Staff without formally laying them off Business Leaders have already seen the studies and they know that forcing people to work from the office leads to higher Staff turnover which in this case is exactly what they want uh but at some point you've got to make a decision to say look this is our policy you have to return to work and be okay with the idea that some employees may say well if that's the case I just can't work for this company anymore investment Banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs which have seen declining revenue from less corporate deal activity are forcing all of their staff to return to the office full time their official communication stress the importance of face-to-face interactions with clients and co-workers senior investment bankers from both firms who love to talk about how much harder they worked when they were analysts accidentally said the quiet part out loud when journalists contacted them about their firm's decision to bring everybody back a senior manager at Goldman declared to the financial times that Goldman does not want to hire people for whom the most important thing is how many days they have to spend in the office at the moment this plan could backfire for businesses unemployment is still low and it's easy for high performing employees to find a new job so managers using this tactic need to be careful or they will be left with nothing but their worst employees an easy way to get rid of Staff without bad publicity is just the first reason so it's time to learn how money Works to find out why you are going to be forced back into the office even if it makes no business sense

how many works the second reason that companies want their staff back in the office despite all the advantages that working from home offers is that they are exposed to real estate that is becoming useless everyone's saying you got to come back to the office now it's just like it's all just giant propaganda to keep real estate commercial real estate market up the value of Office Buildings has slumped as people shift to working from home which is a problem for the companies that have risk exposure to that market around 30 percent of major public companies in America own the office building they are headquartered in this real estate represents a major asset on the balance sheet for those companies Apple Park and Cupertino cost five billion dollars to construct which is a major investment even for a company like apple investors pay close attention to how efficiently companies utilize their assets a big building that is sitting empty is not doing anything to return money to shareholders so there's pressure on company leadership to sell these assets the problem is company Executives trying to sell an office building in today's market would likely take a significant loss on the estimated value listed on the balance sheet this loss would be considered a bad look for for the CEO when it's time for the board to decide their bonus instead of selling an asset that's not being used in realizing the loss a better play for the CEOs to make sure the asset is being used if an office is full then company leadership can justify the capital tied up in a building as it offsets the rent they would have to pay if they didn't own the building most major companies do rent their offices but that can actually put even more pressure on company leadership to get people back in the office the average rental term for office space is much longer than the average rental term for a residential home office spaces require fit outs to make them ready for the companies that will be occupying them office spaces often rented as nothing more than an empty concrete shell and the Landlord and Tenant will negotiate how the office will be built out to fit the needs of the company the typical cost to fill out a high-rise office after the core of the building has been constructed is between 250 and 500 dollars per square foot if managers want their offices to look like the one in suits it will cost even more usually the building owner pays for the fit out so they want to ensure their corporate tenant is going to pay rent for a long time which is why office leases last much longer than residential leases companies that still have their leases from before kovid will be paying money every month for something they are not using but can't get out of a lot of company managers have decided if they are paying for it they might as well use it because the cost benefit of working from home disappears if the company is still paying for an office according to a 2022 office space report on 247 companies conducted by Robin powered found that only 11 percent of companies were fully utilizing their office space 46 percent of the company surveyed were using less than half of their available office space and another 46 percent of companies surveyed said that they plan to reduce office space within the next year but that is difficult with long-term leases one of the only options left to a lot of companies is to default on their leases to open negotiation with the building's owner some perfectly healthy companies have started to do this to try and get rid of a major ongoing expense banks are another group with significant exposure to Office Buildings 3.8 percent of Wells Fargo loans are secured against commercial office space this represents 37 billion dollars in loans or roughly a quarter of the company's market cap banks are under pressure to make sure that offices Remain the standard working environment or they will need to do significant write Downs if defaults continue the third reason that companies are pushing people to come back to the office is because the power that an office can give managers and a lot of that has to do with employers starting to pull back starting to say we are still hiring but we want you on site we want you in place some managers don't actually have that much to do besides stand over their subordinates and look important it's easy to fill a day with redundant tasks in micromanagement in an office but it's harder to do it online senior managers at companies making the decision to bring people back to the office are also going to be more comfortable with work in person than work done online the old soft skills of business like a firm handshake and small talk with colleagues are less relevant online senior managers in the penultimate years of their career have spent most of their lives learning how important these skills are and for many of them it's how they got to their level to begin with straight laced old school business managers are being confronted with a new work culture of online team meetings sat in by someone in their bathrobe and a co-worker's cat professional office culture is something that managers use as a powerful tool for extracting the most out of their subordinates people stay late at the office to get extra work done in large part because they know sitting at their desk in the dark hours after everybody else has left is a good look and demonstrates to their superiors that they are willing to make sacrifices for their career if on the other hand you are someone that works from home you won't get nearly the same recognition for working on something after hours because you are sitting around at home in either case anyway a large motivator for Upward career advancement in the past has been the perks that come with Senior Management in a corporate role if you come into work every day and sit down at a shared desk in an open plan office that has no privacy where you sit short ordered a shoulder with noisy colleagues you would be willing to work extra hard for a promotion if the job gave you your own office with walls and enough room to stretch out without annoying your neighbors according to Studies by Mackenzie the incentive Research Foundation and Princeton non-cash incentives have more of an impact on long-term work motivation than cash incentives so even though we all say that we wouldn't just prefer the extra money the science says we wouldn't the research has presented four reasons why the first reason is that non-cash incentives are easier to see every day you go into work you will see an executive's private parking spot their large office and their personal assistant that fetches them coffee if a company just paid that executive more money instead of offering them visible workplace perks you would never see their big house or retirement savings so you would be less career motivated the second reason is that non-cash incentives are easier to talk about if you get given your own corner office it's easier to talk about than a large salary increase workers should talk about their salaries more but there is still a taboo about it which company management is more than half happy to keep in place so for now people get to brag about their new office more than their big bonus the third reason is that while people say they would prefer extra money it quickly becomes their new normal and the higher income level becomes their new expectation do you remember what your salary was 10 years ago probably not but you would probably remember where you worked the fourth reason is that people just like recognition and even small incentives like their face on the wall for employee of the month goes a long way most of these non-cash Awards need some kind of physical presence to work and working from home quickly makes a role far more transactional and easily comparable with another role where the worker will sit behind the same desk and work the same hours just for different money additionally since most of these perks go to senior managers in a business they are more likely to want to return to work themselves and make the same decisions for everyone else according to a study of 10 000 workers in the summer of 2021 of Executives who primarily worked completely remotely throughout the pandemic 44 said they wanted to come back into the office every day just 17 percent of their employees said the same it's nicer to go back to a comfortable office that you oversee than it is to go back to a shared desk that gets micromanaged managers are also just people and they are more reactive to negative news than positive news a manager is more likely to remember that one employee that played video games at home all day when they should have been working then they are to remember the hours saved by cutting out commute for their entire team leading to small incremental improvements when surveyed most managers believe that working from home had a negative impact on their team's output even though the data suggested exactly the opposite the use of employee monitoring software has increased by 66 percent in the fall of 2021 and even as workers return to the office managers have remained on average more suspicious of their subordinates collecting employee information and getting rid of underperforming staff is one of the reasons that companies have become obsessed with data but it's not the most profitable reason to find out what is go and watch my video on how they have turned your information into a trillion

        "Transcript": "Dive deep into the world of finance and economics with this comprehensive video course. Whether you want to make smarter investment decisions or you're looking to grasp the intricacies of global economies, this course lays a great foundation. The course combines theory with practical insights, paving the way for you to navigate the financial realm with confidence. Sriram originally taught this course in person and now has put together an excellent video course on these important topics. Hello everyone. My name is Sriram Chundi and I'll be taking you through this course on economics and finance and how they're relevant for businesses. Throughout this course, we'll be learning a variety of topics, starting with the key concepts for business, capital markets, valuation of stocks, business strategies and financial statements, how to analyze these financial statements, and things like capital budgeting and cash flow. We'll also discuss things like the business cycle and industry analysis, ESG, macroeconomics, portfolio diversification, and alternative investment types. Throughout this course, you'll learn a variety of different topics in all three of these disciplines and understand the interconnected nature of economics, finance, and business in this world. I also have a YouTube channel called Changemakers Media, which you can see in the comments. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could subscribe there. I share stories on how teens are making an impact in the world and how you can go ahead and support them. Welcome to the first class on economics and finance. So a thought experiment to start. Imagine you had a magic box and it outputs a dollar a day or $5 or $20, how much ever you want, and it runs forever. How much would you pay for this box? Some people say a million dollars, some people say a billion. Well, let's look at it from a statistical standpoint. Instead of a box, let's imagine we have a savings account and it gives you 1.05% interest annually. How much would you have to put into the savings account to generate a dollar a day? Well, using Excel, we can identify that the principal or the original amount we'd have to invest is $34,761. This is a large amount, and fairly so. This is due to the small interest rate that we're getting on in our savings account. Let's look at another example. Imagine you want to buy a house, and the market price is $100,000. You contribute $20,000 towards this down payment and take out an $80,000 mortgage, which is a loan. How much would you have to pay to get rid of the mortgage? Well, if you have an annual contribution of $9,396, you would assume it would take just about 8 or 9 years to pay off the mortgage. But in reality, it takes 20 years, and this is due to the interest rate of 10% applied on this mortgage. If you look towards the bottom over the course of our payments, you notice that from 2019 to 2020, our balance or the principal only drops by $1,400ish. This is because the majority of our $9,000 contribution is going towards paying off interest on the mortgage, and we see this effect persisting throughout the course of our payments. However, it does diminish as the size of the principal decreases and our interest payments decrease. So, our key concepts for today's class. Returnal investment and time value of money, and net present value. So, would you rather make in a return of $1,000 or 25% on an investment? You can't really compare. Apples and Toe origins. So, what is ROI? ROI is a tool that allows you to compare the efficiency of one investment to another investment, thus allowing you to compare apples and oranges. ROI measures the amount of return an investment generates relative to the amount that you invested. So, this is the formula for return on an investment. Current value of an investment minus the cost divided by the cost. So, let's take an example of the house again. Imagine you purchased it for $100,000 upfront. And now, the market value of the house is $150,000. Using the ROI formula, we can deduce that you had a 50% return on investment. So, why is ROI important? Because it allows you to compare assets of different classes and express it as a percentage. It also provides a basic measure as universal to compare an investment's profitability as a basic element in all analysis and decisions for companies and individuals. But it is limited. So, let's look at this example. In investment 1, you invest $1,000 in some real estate and sell it for $1,200 a year later. So, your ROI is 20%. In investment 2, you bought $2,000 a stock and sold it for $2,800 three years later. Using the formula, you have a 40% ROI. So, according to ROI, the second investment is better. But when you look at the time considerations, you spend three times as much time to make that 40% ROI as you did for the 20% ROI. Hence, ROI is not the say all be all measure of the value of an investment. Okay, now let's look at this time value of money. Continuous compounding. So, let's assume you have a savings account and it generates 10% interest per year over 20 years. Initially, you invest $1 into this account. Over the course of 20 years, with that 10% interest rate, the value of your account will rise to $6.73. That's 6.73 times the amount you initially invested. And this is the power of continuous compounding or compound interest. So, time value of money. This concept says that money is worth more today than in the future because of the potential earning capacity that money has, as seen in the example, and because the power of money decreases due to macroeconomic effects such as inflation. So, would you prefer $1 today or $1 in 5 years time? With our previous example, we can deduce that we would like $1 today. This is because we have the potential cash flows that money can create during this period as well as the avoiding of the potential effects of inflation. Now we have net present value, the last of our three key concepts for this section of the video. So, net present value is a pretty straightforward concept. And it's as the name suggests, the net of all cash inflows and cash outflows to determine the value of an asset. Cash inflows and cash outflows essentially represent the income and the sunken costs that an investment has taken. So, how do we calculate the net present value? But before we can calculate it, we need to understand, net present value is an important tool to determine the value of an investment. If net present value is greater than zero, that means an investment was a positive investment generating good returns. Before we can calculate what net present value is, we have to understand something called the discount rate. Discount rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows in a discounted cash flow analysis. Essentially it's the interest rate that the Federal Reserve charges on short term loans. We use it to calculate the value of money in the future due to macroeconomic policies like inflation which decrease the value of future cash flows. So, once we understand what the discount rate is, we can accurately calculate the net present value. So, let's assume you purchased a vending machine. To purchase the vending machine, you had to spend $10,000. This is reflected in year zero with a minus $10,000 cash flow, which is a negative cost. In year one, your vending machine returns you $2,000 in profits, and in subsequent years it returns $3,000, $5,000, and $7,000. So, if you were to add up these numbers, it would give you a $7,000 net present value. However, accounting for the discount rate, which assumes the loss of money due to increasing interest rates, our net present value is only $4,704. Although it's less than the $7,000 that we would have received if money didn't lose value, it's still greater than zero, which indicates that the vending machine is indeed a good investment. Okay, so here we have a Google Sheets laid out with the payments of a mortgage you would make if you were to buy a house. So, referring to a similar example, let's imagine we're buying a house for $150,000 this time. So, you have a 20% down payment, which is $30,000, which leaves you with a payment of $120,000, which you're going to be paying off with a loan. So, let's say your loan principal is $120,000, you have a yearly interest rate of 10%. This means your yearly payment for a 20-year mortgage would come out to $13,896. So, as you can see here, over these 20 years, you're going to be paying off this mortgage with your yearly payments. So, the first, every year you pay off the exact same amount, however, the principal amount decreases. So, in the first year, you start with $120,000. After your first payment, you're left with $118,000, and so on and so forth, until you eventually reach zero at the end of your 20-year mortgage period. However, it's important to note the changes to the principal amount as time progresses. If you notice, from year zero to year one, our principal only decreased by just shy of $2,000, even though you're making a payment for almost $14,000. The reason for this is the majority of your payment is going towards paying off the yearly interest rate on your principal, which is 10% of $120,000, which is $12,000. So, of your $13,896, $12,000 is going towards the interest, and only $1,896 is going towards paying off your principal. This goes to show you how interest rates can actually end up costing you a lot of money. So, $120,000 loan ends up costing $277,904 by the end to pay off the principal and the interest. That means you're paying $157,940 on interest. Alright, so, what are capital and financial markets? What is capital finance and who provides it? And how do businesses and governments obtain financial capital through these markets? So, the financial market is a place where two or more people come together to exchange goods or services. They can be physical places, like a grocery store or supermarket, or virtual places, like for example, the Netflix subscription page. Although this is less obvious of a marketplace, it is still an area where two parties, the individual person subscription and Netflix, come together to exchange goods and services, or in this example, a Netflix subscription, which is a service. So, the importance of financial markets. Financial markets are vital for the growth of firms, as well as achieving individual consumers' desires. Many firms produce goods and services that individuals would not be able to acquire themselves. As a result, it's important for financial markets to exist, so consumers can have access to these goods. It's also important for firms. This is because, unless they're able to trade their goods and services, they won't be able to make returns on what they're producing and grow as a result. So, now we'll go over the stock and bond markets. So first of all, what is a stock? So a stock is a security that represents a portion of ownership in a company. So people can only purchase stocks from a public or private type of company. Public companies are companies that trade their stock on a public platform, or anybody can purchase it. Examples are Amazon, Apple, and Tesla. If you wanted to right now, you could go and purchase their stock. Private companies, on the other hand, are held by certain owners, typically the people who started the company. In certain situations, they may choose to sell their stock, but not on a public platform, only privately to maybe their friends and family. So what are stocks issued? Stocks are issued by companies to raise finances for their goals. These may be expansion, raising money for inventory, and so on. Stocks are also referred to as equity. And as many of you have seen in the Shark Tank show, we see the term equity thrown around. In this example, Kevin offers $400,000 for an $8.2 million valuation. So the company's total equity, or stock, is worth $8.2 million. And Kevin's offering $400,000, which represents 4.8% of that total equity, so he would be owning 4.85% of the total stock of that company. So now what is a bond? A bond is an instrument that represents a loan made by an investor, which is you and a borrower. So bonds can be issued by a variety of places, unlike stocks which are only issued by firms. Bonds can be issued by firms, governments, states, and other government-affiliated organizations. Bonds have four main features. Their issue price, which is what you buy it for. The face value, which includes the price you're buying it for, as well as the interest payments. The coupon rate, or the interest rate, which is the set of payments you'll be receiving over the course of the bond. The coupon date, which is when these payments will be made to you. And the maturity date, which is when a lifetime of the bond is expended and the issue price is returned to you. So bonds are used typically to fund projects for these organizations. They only last for a certain period of time, as determined by the maturity rate when the bond is issued, and they either have fixed or variable payments. Something interesting about bonds is that they're inversely related to interest rates in the market. This is because as interest rates rise, the lower coupon rate of the bonds become less desirable. As a result, bond issuers lower their price. An example of a government-funded project could be developing infrastructure, such as buildings, schools, paving roads, and so on. If the government doesn't already have enough funds to do this project, they may issue bonds to raise capital and pursue these projects. So the differences between stocks and bonds. So typically stocks are more risky. This is due to the volatility of the stock market, resulting in companies' values appreciating and depreciating. Additionally, stocks are only issued by firms or companies. Stocks also give you ownership over a company, and you get paid in the form of dividends and appreciation in the value of the company. Dividends are when companies may choose to offer you some money that they make from their profits. And appreciation is when the total value of the company rises. As a result, when you purchase a stock, for say for example when the company stock is worth $100 and it appreciates to $120, you make money off of that $20 appreciation. Additionally, stocks give you ownership over a company, and in some situations will give you decision-making power. So now bonds. Bonds are seen as less risky because they have fixed payments, which are determined when the bond is purchased, and once they mature, you get your initial payment back. Bonds are issued also by firms and governments, along with other organizations. Bonds are in the form of debt, not ownership. So when you purchase a bond, the person that you purchase the bond from will be making you payments. Furthermore, bonds don't give you any decision-making power since they're only debt and not ownership. We can see the risk between bonds and stocks in this example. So here, the stocks are represented by the dark blue line, whereas the bonds are represented by the light purple. The stock prices are very volatile as they're swinging up and down cyclically almost, whereas bonds are on a steady, much less volatile growth rate. This represents how stocks are much more volatile, and when, at certain dates, if you choose to sell a stock, you may make a negative return, whereas if you choose, well, bonds you can't sell. But once your bond reaches a maturity, you're almost guaranteed to make profits, unless the company or organization that you purchase the bond from defaults or goes bankrupt. So how do we value stocks on any asset in general? Well there's two main factors that we have to include when trying to value a stock or bond or any asset for that matter. The expected cash flows and the risk associated with the value. As we discussed earlier, cash flows are the total revenues we'll be making, along with the sunken costs of bursting an asset. And risk. Risk can be represented with the chance for financial losses or the chance that a company even goes bankrupt and you lose your value. Okay, so stock valuation. There is a lot of uncertainty when valuing a stock, and part of this is due to the fact that there's so many different ways to value a stock. For example, there's the discounted cash flow method, which we'll be looking into next. There's the constant growth divided by dividend discount method, and there's also techniques called comparables, which we'll also be discussing, such as price to earnings, price to books, and price to sales. As a result, there's no standard convention to measure a stock, and when people are comparing stocks, it's best to use the most information you have available to you and try and do all these techniques, which is, of course, unviable in the real world though. So, the discounted cash flow method. Discounted cash flow method is similar to what we discussed in the previous section, where we take all the expected cash flows for an asset, including the sunken costs and the revenues that it slightly generate in the future, and discount these values, meaning we adjust the value of money in accordance with macroeconomic features like inflation and so on to ensure that the future value of money is converted to the present value of money. So, what are the pros of this technique? Theoretically, this is the most sound method if the analyst is confident in their assumptions and forecasts. Additionally, it's not significantly influenced by temporary market conditions or non-economic factors. Like if the industry is suffering from a temporary lack of resources, this technique ensures that those factors are overcome when calculating the value. And this is especially useful when a company you're valuing is in an industry where there's no other competitors or very limited competitors, so that way there's limited or no comparable information. As a result, you only base your forecasts off the individual company. The cons of this technique are that it can vary over a wide range of values, because the predictions are based on forecasts which are likely to be inaccurate. Additionally, it's very time intensive compared to the other evaluation techniques which we'll discuss later. And additionally, forecasting future performance is very difficult since it requires lots of statistical tools, and again, it is likely to be inaccurate or imprecise. So valuation frameworks, we'll be looking at comps now. So what are comps? Comps are also called comparables or multiples, and it is a valuation technique that is based on comparing companies within an industry. It involves using metrics such as price to earnings, price to books, and other relevant ratios to that of similar companies in the same industry. The rationale behind using comps lies in the principle that companies within the same industry tend to have similar financial and operational characteristics due to shared market and economic factors. By evaluating the valuation of a company against its peers, investors can gain insights into its performance within the industry and whether it's over, under, or fairly valued. So the two most popular forms of comps are price to earnings ratio and something called enterprise value to EDITDA or EBITDA. So these are examples of certain types of comps. We have price to earnings, price to sales, enterprise value to earning before interest, tax, and appreciation, price to cash flow, and price to earnings. The reason these are better than discounting cash flow in terms of time is that their ratios so they can be calculated very quickly. All you have to do is go to the financial documents of a company, look at their numbers of their reporting, and calculate them, which allows for swift and easy comparison between companies within the same industry. Alright, in this section we'll be going over business strategy and any of the financial documents related to it. So first, what is business strategy? Well, it's a plan of action or a policy designed to achieve the major or overall aim of a company. So it's the time to develop a coherent economic strategy and the plans to ensure the future success of the company in both its goals and financial success. So one key aspect of the business strategy is the mission statement. The mission statement is the summary of the aims and the values of a company. The key elements of a mission statement are the purpose, the target audience, an explanation of the business, how the business is unique, and the values that the business has. And it has to do all of these things in just a couple sentences. So let's look at a couple examples. Here we have Microsoft, and their business statement is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We have Honda, maintaining a global viewpoint, we are dedicated to supplying products of the highest quality yet at a reasonable price for worldwide customer satisfaction. And Walmart, to save people money so that they can live better. Across these three statements, there's common features. One, they're short, two, they're easy to remember, and three, they showcase the core values and missions of these companies. Okay, so the next part about a company analysis. There's various tools that companies include to create their business statement. And one of these principle tools is a SWOT analysis. A SWOT analysis helps a company position themselves and understand where they are in the marketplace against their competitors. There are four key elements of SWOT analysis, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, which thus produce the name SWOT. So the strengths of a company are its competitive advantage, the assets that it had that are proprietary and products that are performing well. These are the strengths because they are unique features of a company that other competitions don't have. The weaknesses of a company are things that they lack that their competitors have, things that their competitors do better and any resource limitations that a company may be experiencing. So strengths and weaknesses are within the company and its operations. Then we have opportunities and threats. Threats are new legislature which threatens a company's operations, any new emerging competition, and changes to consumer attitudes and opinions. Opportunities are technologies that a company can integrate to improve its processes, emerging press and media which can help a company generate any publicity, and underserved markets that a company can integrate themselves into. Threats and opportunities are not directly involved in the company and are external and can be affecting the company over time. So here we have a bit more of a detailed explanation of what strengths and weaknesses are. So strengths are the internal attributes and resources of a company that propel the company towards success. It represents the area where your organization outperforms others, evident by both your competitors and your customers. Weaknesses are the facets that hinder favorable outcomes for your business. They pinpoint areas that require improvements, shedding light on where your company falls short compared to its competitors. Opportunities encompass external elements that can be leveraged to your advantage. These are prevailing market trends that, when capitalized upon using your strengths, can enhance revenue and provide a competitive edge. Threats denote external factors that jeopardize your organization's success. These encompass advantages held by competitors. To mitigate these risks, it's crucial to employers' strengths strategically. Swat analysis, when used, can help a company understand where it is now in its industry and what the future holds and how the company can progress itself in a beneficial way. One more tool that a business can use to help it understand the importance of certain products or services it sells is the BCG matrix. The BCG matrix, otherwise known as the Boston Consulting Group matrix, is a business analysis tool that helps organizations assess their product portfolio's performance and potential. As you can see on the diagram, there are four different categories, stars, cash cows, question marks and dogs, and you can categorize products depending on their market growth rate and their relative market share. Stars, these are products with high market shares that are in fast-growing markets. They have the potential to generate significant profits due to their position in this industry. So if a company dominates 90% of the market share for a niche that is growing very fast, the product that they're selling is likely to be a star. Cash cows are products that have high market shares in markets that aren't growing so fast. While they may not have as much growth potential, they generate steady cash flow, which is often desirable for businesses. So similar to stars, but they don't have the future potential and instead they're making money right now. Question marks are products that companies may have low market share in, however the market is likely to expand in the future. They require consideration as to whether a company should invest in it to develop its market share and potentially create it into a star or to let it go and become a dog. And dogs are products that have a low market share and a market growth in a market that isn't growing. They won't generate significant profits for the company and if a company needs to reduce some of its services that it's offering, the dogs are the first to go. The BCG Matrix can help a company allocate its resources effectively by suggesting strategies for products or services that fall into each specific quadrant. And the last strategic business tool we'll talk about is Porter's Generic Strategies. Porter's Generic Strategies are a set of strategic approaches developed by Michael Porter, as the name suggests, to help businesses understand where they stand in the industry and to help them gain a competitive advantage. So again, there are four quadrants in this diagram. There's cost leadership, differentiation, cost focus, and differentiation focus. So cost leadership is a strategy that focuses on becoming the lowest cost producer in an industry. This is achieved by economies of scale, efficient operations, and cost controls. This can attract a wide consumer customer base and potentially deter new entrants from the industry. Then we have differentiation. Differentiation aims to create a unique or distinctive product unlike others on the market. And this can be achieved through unique product design, branding, or even customer service. By offering something that's valuable and unique, companies can often charge premium prices and customers will be willing to pay. And then as we move to the bottom, there are the focus or niche strategies in the niche market. These strategies often involve concentrating efforts on a specific market or a specific segment. This can be done either through cost focus or through differentiation focus, which means becoming the lowest cost leader in a niche and offering a uniquely tailored product in a niche respectively. By focusing on smaller specialized markets, companies can build stronger relationships with their customers and it's much easier to maintain these relationships. By choosing one of these generic strategies, businesses can align their operations, marketing efforts, and resource allocations to create a sustainable competitive advantage. So now we'll be looking at the three main financial statements that all companies need to report or financial documents rather. So we have the statement of profit or loss, the statement of financial position and the cash flow forecast. It's important to note that these documents do have different names that they're referred to as I've indicated some of the popular other forms in parentheses. So if you do go on the internet and you come across an income statement or profit or loss statement, please do know that they're the same thing. So each of these statements has a different purpose, which we'll be exploring soon. And when combined together, they provide an in-depth look at the through the lens of finances and performance at how a company is performing and whether its stock is good. And also keep in mind that all publicly traded companies need to report these three documents to ensure transparency with the public and their investors, whereas private companies don't need to report this. Also note that in these documents, any negative numbers or losses will be represented with parentheses around them. In earlier examples, I use the color red. However, in financial documents, it's important to know all negative numbers are in parentheses. All right. So first we have the statement of profit or loss. The statement of profit or loss is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses of a company over a period of time. So just to start with, all of these financial documents have this opening section. It will of course include the title, the company, and what type of financial document it is. And more importantly, the period of time that is coming from. So in this example, we have the end of the year at whatever year. Okay. So the statement of profit or loss is also known as the statement of operations, statement of financial results or income, the earning statement, the expense statement, income statement, and so on. It's important to compare this profit and loss statement over time to see changes within a company. So this example, we only have it for one year, but investors typically look at several years and compare it on a horizontal analysis, which we'll look at later, to see the growth of a company over time. So whenever we're looking at this document, it's important to start from the top. So we look at the sales revenue, and as we go, we slowly reduce the total sales revenue until we receive the retained profit. So starting at costs of sales, this includes the cost of manufacturing goods and the costs through which you would have to sell it. This includes lighting at the store and so on. This leads you to gross profit. Then after expenses, you get your profits before interest in tax. After paying interest, you get profits before tax. After paying your taxes, you get profit for your period. So this is essentially all the surplus that a company has left over. Then you pay your dividends to your shareholders, and this leads the retained profit for the company. So it's important to note that this is for a profit-making entity. Even non-profit-making entities do report these statements. However, in place of profit, they use the term surplus, since they aren't, well, for profit, right? So the statement of financial position. This statement's a bit longer, so we'll look at it in two parts, assets and liabilities. But essentially this statement says, at the end of a financial period, where do you as a company stand? So the first half, the assets. So again, looking from the top, we have the name of the company, title of the document, and the period that it's reporting for. So in this section, we look at the assets, and assets are split into non-current and current assets. So non-current assets are assets that a company will be holding for a period greater than a year. This includes things like the factory that it's built on, any of the technical equipment they have, and so on. Current assets, on the other hand, are assets that a company will hold for less than a period of a year. This includes things like cash, debtors, and stock. So when you calculate the total value of non-current assets, you get 800 here, and current assets is a 1100. So your total assets add up to 1900. One thing that you may notice is accumulated depreciation, and it's in parentheses, and it's a negative factor. Although it's beyond the scope of this course, I'll give you a quick look at what depreciation is. It's an accounting technique used by companies to reduce their overall assets, which can help them in terms of tax breaks and so on. But yeah, when you add your non-current assets and your current assets, you get your total assets of 1900. Now liabilities, again, liabilities are split into current liabilities and non-current liabilities. Current liabilities are liabilities that a company will hold for a period less than a year. And non-current are liabilities that a company will hold for a period greater than a year. Things like bank overdraft, which are essentially drawing from a bank account until it gets to a negative point, is a current liability. Trade predators is when a company is trading with another company, and the person you're trading with allows you to pay later, essentially like an IOU. And we also have short-term loans, which will be paid back in a period less than a year. And these add up to your total current liabilities. Other non-current liabilities are just long-term loans, which you would take out from the bank. And these add up to your total liabilities. Your net assets are your total assets minus your total liabilities. So your total assets are 1900, and your total liabilities are 800. So 1900 minus 800 gives you 1100, which is your net assets. And an important calculation to know to see if you've done the financial position correct is to take your assets and equate them to liabilities plus shareholder equity. If this comes out equal, then you've done it right. Shareholder equity is essentially the share capital, the value of your shares, and the retained earnings of a company for the period. So yeah, that's your statement of financial position. And now we have the cash flow forecast. The cash flow forecast is for a shorter period of time, and it talks about all the money going in and out of a company for, in this case, three months. So yeah, it allows advisors to assess the individual inflows and outflows of a company to determine how important certain things in the company are and how expensive they are and how they can be cut down to improve the total net cash flow of a company. It also allows the company, it also allows for a month by month comparison to see the growing effects of the company's operations. So as you see here in January, the opening balance is 800. However, the total cash outflows, which are 306, are greater than the inflows, which are 300. And as a result, the closing balance decreases by 6, 6 million. So you have a closing balance of 2 million. And we see this negative cash flow going over a period of three months, which allows us to see that operating at this state for this company has negative effects and then suggests that some outflows need to be decreased or inflows need to be increased. Otherwise, companies may need to take out other, incorporate other forms of finances. So the importance of these forms, these three forms, as I stated earlier, need to be made public for publicly traded companies. It's important that companies ensure transparency with their investors and with the public so that investors can make informed decisions whether they should invest in the company. These documents are also important for people within the company to ensure that to create calculations like return on equity or ROE. And you can only do that by comparing across these documents or cross referencing. So yeah, even now you can search up a certain publicly traded company and find these financial documents on the internet. However, you won't be able to do so with private companies. So now we'll be looking at how to analyze these financial statements that we've just discussed. So there's three techniques that we can use. You can use ratios, a horizontal analysis, and a common size technique. So first we'll go over ratios, which are, in my opinion, the simplest way and the quickest way to analyze. So there's four types of ratios, profitability ratios, which measure your return on investment, your liquidity ratios, which measure how easily you can move your money around, activity ratios, which are representation of your day to day operations, and leverage ratios, which represent how well you can utilize debt. So we have profitability ratios. Profitability ratios are financial indicators used to evaluate a company's ability to generate profits relative to its revenue, assets, and equity. Key profitability ratios include the gross profit margin, as you can see on screen, which measures profit after deducting production costs or cost of goods sold, and the net profit margin, which assesses overall profit after all expenses. We also have return on assets and return on equity, which are common ratios that show how efficiently a company generates profits from its assets and shareholder equity, respectively. These ratios help investors and stakeholders gauge the company's profitability and its effectiveness in turning revenue into earnings. So as you can see, I have the formulas for each of these profitability ratios listed on screen, and all of this information can obviously be found from three financial documents. Next we have liquidity ratios. Liquidity ratios are a financial metrics that assess a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations. They measure the firm's ability to convert assets into cash quickly to recover or cover immediate liabilities. Common liquidity ratios include the current ratio, which divides the current assets by current liabilities, and the quick ratio, which excludes less liquid assets like inventory. These ratios provide insights into a company's financial health and its capacity to handle unexpected expenses or downturns. High liquidity ratios generally indicate better short-term financial stability and flexibility, however they aren't the ultimate analysis technique for liquidity. Activity ratios are also known as asset utilization ratios, and they analyze how efficiently a company manages to use its assets to generate revenue. They provide insights into how well a company utilizes its resources and operations. For example, we have inventory turnover, which measures how quickly inventory is sold and replenished, and things like average collection period. Activity ratios help businesses optimize their operations, manage working capital, and identify areas where improvements can lead to increased productivity and profitability. Finally, we have debt leverage ratios. Debt ratios are financial metrics that evaluate a company's level of debt in relation to its equity or assets. These ratios offer insights into a company's financial leverage and risk. Common debt ratios include the debt-to-asset ratio, which measures debt relative to the total assets a company has. This ratio helps assess the company's ability to handle its debt obligations, and also provides valuable information for investors and creditors regarding the firm's financial stability and its transfer risk. Alright, so there's nuances to these ratios. Although these ratios are super simple and easy to calculate, they aren't that useful when you're comparing firms across industries. So for example, we have Walmart and Honda. If we take the example of the liquidity ratios with the quick ratio, you can't compare Honda and Walmart. It's likely that one of the companies will have very different styles of inventory, and the way they process their equipment is very different. However, these ratios are useful when you're comparing companies within the same industry in the same position. Alright, so now we can go through a quick simplified version of a consolidated income statement and all these financial documents to calculate two ratios, the gross profit margin and the net profit margin for Tesla. So I got this data from the Wall Street Journal, and it's just a consolidated income statement of Tesla with all this information here. So to calculate the gross profit margin, I have the formula right here. So it's the revenues minus the cost of goods sold divided by the total revenues. So using Excel, we can use the minus function to take the revenues, which is right here, and subtract it from the cost of goods sold, which is right here. And this gives us 20,853. And now we can use the divide function to divide this value by the total revenues, which is the formula right here. And this gives us the gross profit margin ratio of 0.255, and so on. And now we can do the same thing with the net profit margin. But this is much more simple. This is just the net income divided by revenues. So we take the divide function, and we look for the net income, which is right here. And you take this, and you divide it by the revenues, which is right here again. And using Excel, we can calculate it to be 0.15446. So this is a super simplified example. The information on this Excel sheet is very basic. In reality, when you're calculating some of the other ratios, you're going to need to cross reference these financial documents, because lots of the information is located on the cash flow forecast, some is reporting the income statement, and so on. So as a result, it becomes a lot more complicated. But if you have access to all the other files, which you should for publicly traded companies, you'll be able to do these calculations no problem. The next technique is horizontal analysis or trend analysis. So horizontal analysis of financial statements involves comparing financial ratios and benchmarks or any item over a number of accounting periods. This method is also known as trend analysis. So horizontal analysis allows the assessment of relative changes in different aspects of the financial statements to be seen over time. So let's look at this example. One thing to notice when you're reading these statements over time is that the most recent years represented on the left most column and the most and the oldest years on the right most column, which kind of goes against our left to right reading style in English. So it's important to keep that in mind. But if we look at the numbers, we see a growth in the sales, a growth in the cost of sales, a growth in profit and so on. So this can be calculated. So the change, the numerical change can be calculated and listed in this column. And the percentage change can be listed here. The percentage change is calculated by taking the difference and dividing it by the overall amount. So that's also called the year over year change. So returning to our consolidated income statement for Tesla that we saw in the previous example, we can see the same changes happening over time. So the leftmost column is the most recent year, which is 2022, and the rightmost column is 2018. So this records data for Tesla over the course of five years. Keep in mind that some of this data happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have skewed results. So that shows you that it's important to realize that macroeconomic effects like a pandemic or other industrial shocks can affect this data. But in large, it's not that big of a contribution, at least to Tesla. So if we look, we see a growth in sales revenue. So from 21,000, 24,000, 31,000, and then rapid growth from 2020 to 2022, with 20,000 growth and then 30,000 growth. At the same processes can be seen across various other factors or various other items. And this goes to show you how this horizontal statement can be used to analyze growth over time, even with Tesla. The last tool we'll be discussing in this section is common size analysis, which is a financial state. The last technique we'll be discussing in this section is common size analysis. Common size financial statements show each line item expressed as a percentage of a base figure within the statement, and it's used for vertical analysis. So common size financial statements help to analyze and compare a company's performance over several periods. The common size percentages can subsequently be used to compare those of competitors and determine how a company is performing relative to the rest of the industry. A common size income statement is an income statement in which each line item is expressed as a percentage of the value of revenue or sales. A common size balance sheet is a balance sheet that displays both a numeric value and relative percentage for total assets. So in the following example, we'll be looking over a common size statement for an income statement or balance sheet. Okay, so here we have a generic example of what one would look like. As you can see, we have the normal side of a balance sheet or a statement of financial position, except one more column is added that expresses everything as percentages. In this example, you would think percentages aren't too helpful, and you'd be right. And that's because the numbers here are very straightforward. The total assets are 100,000, which makes 100%. And all these numbers are very straightforward. However, in a situation where numbers are much more miscellaneous and intricate, these percentages help to clarify and watch more information. Here this is extremely helpful because it can show us what percent of our assets, for example, our current assets are in which form. So in this example, for our current assets, the majority is in the form of total cash and inventory, whereas the rest is in the form of prepaid expenses and accounts receivables. This can suggest that the company may need to invest its total cash into other assets that can generate revenue, and it may have an inventory issue, turning inventory into actual revenue. And if we look at our non-current assets, the majority of our assets are in our plan, property and equipment, whereas very little is in our goodwill. This can help us identify what value certain parts of our business bring and what parts aren't as helpful. So in the non-current example, we see how we have so much value in our equipment, our property, and our plant, whereas the brand name and value, which is goodwill, isn't that strong. This can also help us identify which parts of our liabilities are the greatest and which parts are the weakest, and how we can take future steps to address these and prevent any other issues from rising. This same thing can be seen for other forms of statements like the income statement, which I mentioned earlier, but it's essentially the same thing just in another financial statement. All right. So let's say you have the opportunity to install solar panels on your house. The solar panel company says it's going to cost you $10,000 to install solar panels. But they say in the long run, you're going to be able to save money. Should you make the investment? Well, in this class, we're going to be in this section, we're going to be talking about capital budgeting. So what is capital budgeting? Why do we do it? And how is it done? And with these tools, we can answer whether we should make the investment for the solar panels. So first, what is capital budgeting? Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating and selecting long term investment projects like solar panels that involve significant financial outlays. It's a decision making processes for businesses and individuals to determine which projects are worth pursuing based on their potential to generate returns or benefits over an extended period. Capital budgeting helps organizations and individuals allocate their financial resources effectively, maximizing the value of investments and minimizing the risk of making poor choices. It's a systematic approach that considers not only the immediate costs and returns, but also the long term impact on financial performance and overall strategic goals of an individual or business. Okay, so first of all, why do companies even make investments in fixed assets? Well, investments can increase capacity, they can overcome some regulations, they are innovative, which can give companies a unique advantage. And there's so many other reasons. But why is capital budgeting important for valuation? Capital budgeting is important for several reasons, but I'll give you three main reasons. First of all, it helps the resource allocation. There's limited financial resources and capital budgeting can help ensure companies focus on the most promising investments. It also helps for long term planning. This is because it allows companies to plan for the future by considering the effects of their investment using tools that we'll discuss later, over an extended period and manage risk while maximizing returns. And it also considers the time value of money, again, which we'll discuss further. But capital budgeting considers the time value of money, recognizing that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. This also ensures that cash flow predictions are properly discounted. Okay, so how do companies pay for investments? They pay for it in three ways using cash flow, debt, and equity. So before we continue, there's two more concepts you need to understand before we're able to discuss capital budgeting and how to actually consider it. Internal Rate of Return, or IRR for short, and Cost of Capital. The Internal Rate of Return, or IRR, is a finance term that helps us assess how lucrative an investment or project could be. IRR is the annual growth that an investment is expected to make. If the IRR is higher than what you could earn from a safe investment, like a bank deposit or investing in some safe stocks, then the project might be worth the risk. In short, IRR helps us decide if a business idea is a good investment. So the steps of capital budgeting. First, a project proposal is developed. This involves either individuals or businesses looking at an opportunity to make an investment and thinking it's a good idea. Then management reviews and prioritizes projects based on their economic viability. So after looking at the potential cash flow projections, management will either decide if an investment is positive or negative for the company and thus decide to prioritize or ignore it. Then funds are allocated on these projects to ensure the development and the results are tracked to see if the projections are accurate. If projections are inaccurate, funds are either removed, reduced, or increased. After the investment is completed, companies can reflect on the process and decide whether future similar investments should be made. So Capital Cash Flows. The value of an initial investment is equal to the cost of the new asset plus the installation's cost associated with the new asset minus the after-tax proceeds from selling the old asset. Keep in mind the after-tax proceeds from selling an old asset is equal to the sale price minus the tax on capital gain, which is a bit advanced from this course. But all you need to understand is that that is considered when calculating the price of the initial investment. So capital budgeting results in changes in working capital. If a current asset increases in value, it's a use of working capital. If current liabilities increase, it's a source of working capital. That means current assets are cash, or inventory, which are uses of capital, and liabilities are things like loans, which are sources of working capital. An increase in networking capital means it's a source of cash for the company, and a decrease is a use of cash. So capital budgeting are the three main methods that we use to decide whether we should invest our payback period, which we'll discuss next, net present value, which we've discussed earlier, and IRR, which we've all just discussed. So payback period, it's a very basic concept, and it essentially discusses how long it takes for a company to recoup its investments on a fixed asset. So in this example, we have a Ford factory. Initially it costs $5,000 to invest in this Ford factory. However, as the years go on, it generates positive cash flows. So payback period essentially looks at how long it takes for the company to generate, to receive a net positive cash flow. And as you can see, initially the cash flows, the cumulative cash flow is negative until year four, when it finally breaks positive. Okay, so now let's return back to our example. Our solar panel costs $10,000. Should we make the investment? So using capital budgeting techniques, we can predict the cash flows. So the cash flows over the years are $2,000, $2,500, $3,500, $4,000, and $4,500, with an initial cost of $10,000. Should we install these panels? Well, if you look at the cost of capital, which is 12%, that means any other investment we could invest in would generate $1,200 in net present value. If our investment on the solar panels is greater than our other cost of capital, then it's a good investment. So using discounting our cash flows, we can find a value. We find that the value of the solar panels, the net present value of the solar panels is $1,219, which is greater than the value of, which is greater than our cost of capital. So here we can see how we calculate our net present value and how it shifts based on our discount rate and our cash flows. So this Excel function is set up so that the discount rate is called percent, which is our cost of capital, and our cash flows are accounted for. And you can do this by typing equals NPV, selecting the discount, comma, and selecting our cash flows, which yields the same number here and here. So if we wanted to adjust our factors to see how it would be in different scenarios, we can change these numbers and see how it would work. So if our discount rate was instead of 12%, 20%, you can see how our net present value has decreased. This suggests that other investments which have higher, which are better cost of capital could have been a better investment than investing in these solar panels. However, if we decrease our cost of capital to something like 5%, we see the net present value increases even greater. This shows how different costs of capital can affect the net present value of our investment by comparing alternative investments. Additionally, we can look at how cash flow affects the net present value. If our initial cash flow is 20,000 instead of 10,000, thus essentially making the cost was double, our net present value decreases significantly. This shows how the price of investment can also affect the value. And that increasing our cash flows significantly increases our net present value. Alright, in this section, we'll be talking about macroeconomics. So first of all, what is macroeconomics? Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the overall behavior of an economy focusing on large scale factors like economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and national income. It examines how policies and events impact the economy as a whole rather than individuals such as individual businesses or individual markets. Some of the key factors in macroeconomics are the size of the economy, economic growth, government policy, fiscal policy, monetary policy, inflation, and international trade. Most of these which we'll touch upon. So one thing that we should understand is the business cycle. The business cycle is very intertwined with economics. Everything is cyclical. So the business cycle, also known as the economic cycle, is the recurring pattern of fluctuations and an economy's overall activity over time. It can be divided into four main phases, as you guys can see in this diagram. In this example, it starts with the trough or the lowest point. So the trough is the lowest point in the business cycle. At this point, economic activity is at its lowest and economic conditions are the worst. However, at this point, the economy sets the stage for a potential turnaround as it moves into the expansion stage. Some of the features of this stage is monetary and fiscal policy employed by the central banks and government, which we'll touch upon later, starting to rise in economic growth, an increase in employment and manufacturing from this trough, and a gradual shift towards increases in profits. Next we have the expansion phase. During this phase, economic activity such as production, employment, and consumer spending is on the rise, as set by the trough. Businesses are expanding and there's a general sense of optimism and an increase in consumer confidence throughout the economy. Growth is driven by an increase in consumer demand, investment, and also by monetary and fiscal policy. As you can see, the effects of fiscal and monetary policy are starting to benefit, however, the governments and central banks are drawing back on their intervention. Economic growth is also still positive, however, it's not as rapid as it was during the trough. At this stage, companies are still hiring and manufacturing activity is ongoing and margins of companies also start to increase. Then we reach the peak. The peak is the highest point of economic activity in the business cycle. At this stage, growth begins to slow and even starts to decrease, and the economy reaches a state of maximum output. However, signs of potential inflationary pressures may begin to emerge. At this point, fiscal and monetary policies employed by central banks and governments may go in the opposite direction to prevent too much growth, which is inflation. Additionally, economic growth stagnates and employers have trouble finding workers and wages increase in value. This is an effect of inflation. Additionally, earnings start to disappoint workers against high expectations due to economic growth. This leads into a recession or a contraction. So following the peak, the economy enters this contractionary phase. Economic indicators like GDP, employment, and consumer spending, which we touched upon earlier, start to decline. Businesses cut down on production, start laying off employees, and this may result in a decrease in consumer confidence. This phase is commonly referred to as a recession, but this term varies depending on the severity and duration of this period. Business cycle is driven by various factors, including shifts in consumer and investor sentiments, increased technology, and changes to monetary and fiscal policies. However, it is continuous and it always happens. However, one thing to note is that in this graph, we see the business cycle as reaching the trough again, right? But one thing to notice is that the economy is constantly growing, so it's on an upward trend. However, these cycles go throughout the upward trend, if that makes sense. If you look closely here, the trough in the original early cycle is a bit lower than the trough after we reached the recession. This shows that the economy is growing, however, while it's growing, it is experiencing cycles. Okay, so the key factors of the macro-economy that we'll be touching upon. GDP, or gross domestic product, unemployment slash unemployment, inflation, and interest rates, which we've already discussed. So first, what is GDP? GDP, or the gross domestic product of a company, represents the total cost of goods being sold in that country or in that nation in a period, typically one year. So GDP is calculated as consumer spending, which is C, investments made, which is I, government spending, which is G, and the difference between exports and imports, which is represented as X minus M. Okay, something to note about industries and the business cycles. Certain industries and companies are divided into categories called cyclical or defensive categories. Cyclical industries are industries which face the repercussions of the business cycle. During certain times, they will be in an upward boom, and during certain times, they may not be able to operate at all. Examples of this include the hotel industry, resorts, dining, and any other excessive industries that are created by consumer wants. Defensive industries, on the other hand, are things that aren't too heavily affected by the business cycle. This is because they're necessary for human operation. Things like this include health services, utilities, health technology, and so on. However, some industries are in between cyclical and defensive. For example, consumer services are somewhat cyclical and somewhat defensive. For example, things like accommodation are cyclical and defensive to some extent. Some houses in certain areas, which may be seen as luxury, may be cyclical when it comes to renting or on Airbnb. However, basic accommodation is defensive since humans need it at all times. So first, unemployment. So unemployment is split into three categories, cyclical, structural, and frictional. So what is cyclical unemployment? Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the overall economy. When the economy enters a recession or a downturn, demand for goods and services decreases, causing businesses to scale back production. As a result, they lay off workers leading to cyclical unemployment. Consider the construction industry. During an economic boom, there's a high demand for new homes and infrastructural projects. Construction companies hire more workers to meet this growing demand. However, when a recession hits, the demand for new projects drops, causing these companies to cut back on their workforce, resulting in cyclical unemployment for construction workers. Similarly, in the tourism sector, when the economy is thriving, people have more disposable income to travel and explore. This leads to increased demand for flights, hotels, entertainment like movies, and so on. Yet, in an economic downturn, people tighten their budgets, leading to reduced travel and low demand for these tourism-related services. And as a result, there are losses in jobs in this industry. In both examples, cyclical unemployment is closely tied to the fluctuations in the business cycle which we saw earlier. As the economy contracts and expands, industries that heavily rely on consumer spending and investments can experience shifts in employment levels due to the changes in demand. Next we have structural unemployment. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the skills and qualifications of job seekers and the requirements of available jobs. This mismatch is often caused by changes in the economy, such as due to technology or shifts in consumer preferences, making certain skills obsolete or less in demand. For instance, let's consider the decline of the typewriter industry with the advent of computers. Skill typists, who were very proficient at using the typewriter, might have found themselves structurally unemployed as the demand for their specific skillset, efficient use of the typewriter, dwindled due to technological advancements. This is because computers were much more efficient, much more accessible, and people could do the same job that typewriters could do at home by themselves. Another example could be seen in the decline of manufacturing jobs in certain regions. As manufacturing processes became more automated, companies may require fewer workers on the factory floor. This can lead to structural unemployment as individuals with specific skills to manual assembly or machine operations face challenges of finding relevant employment. In the modern context, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and automation could potentially lead to structural employment for certain administrative roles which do work that AI can easily replace. These include tasks like data entry or customer service, which AI, even at its current state, can likely handle, rendering these traditional jobs unnecessary. Structural unemployment underscores the importance of continuous skill development and adaptation to changing job markets. Individuals need to retain and acquire new skills to remain competitive in an evolving landscape and minimize the impact of structural shifts in the economy. Lastly, we have frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is likely the type of unemployment that most people will experience. It occurs when individuals are transitioning between jobs or entering the workforce for the first time. It's a natural and unavoidable aspect of a dynamic job market, where people are constantly seeking better, higher-paying jobs with better benefits, while employers are looking for better and better candidates. Imagine a recent college graduate entering the job market. They might experience frictional unemployment as they search for their first full-time position. During this time, they're looking for a job that aligns with their skills, interests, career goals, pay, and maybe it's even close to their house. This process of searching and applying and interviewing and negotiating tasks takes time and can result in temporary unemployment, which we refer to as frictional unemployment. Another example is when someone voluntarily leaves a job to pursue a new opportunity. They may experience frictional unemployment during the gap between leaving one job and starting their next job. This gap is often necessary to handle the logistics of transitioning, such as relocating or completing necessary paperwork. Frictional unemployment, while inevitable, can be reduced through effective job search strategies, networking, and the use of online job platforms. It's important to note that frictional unemployment is generally considered to be a healthy aspect of a dynamic job market, as it reflects the individual's ability to move and their flexibility in pursuing opportunities that best fit their skill sets and aspirations. So, inflation. When we're calculating GDP, as we learned earlier, the value of money changes over time. Money in the future is not worth the same as it is right now. As a result, GDP numbers without being deflated could show consistent growth, whereas in reality, the real GDP, which is what we refer to GDP with the time value of money taken into account, could be decreasing. As a result, to calculate the real GDP of a country, we take the nominal GDP, which is what would be reported, and we take away the impact of inflation. Okay, so who is really playing a role in the macroeconomy? So, the two main players that control it are the governments and central banks, which implement and develop policies. And as a result, companies and consumers are impacted by these changes and need to react. So, governments implement fiscal policy, whereas banks implement monetary policy. So, first, what is monetary policy? Monetary policy involves a bank's management of a country's money supply and interest rates to influence economic activity. By adjusting interest rates and employing tools like open market operations, central banks can control inflation, encourage borrowing, and spending during slow economic periods using expansionary monetary policy, or cool down an overheating economy using a contractionary monetary policy. Expansionary monetary policy is when central banks reduce interest rates to make borrowing money easier for consumers. This is because the interest they would have to pay on a loan reduces, taking the loan much more appealing. Contractionary monetary policy, on the other hand, is when central banks increase interest rates to make borrowing more expensive, causing borrowers to pay more interest on their loans, decreasing the appeal of these loans. An interesting example of monetary policy in action is Japan's use of interest rates to stimulate the economy. Typically, in a country that is using expansionary monetary policy, interest rates could be lowered from 3% to 2%, for example, to encourage borrowing. Japan, however, decided to take an unconventional approach. The Bank of Japan set an interest rate of negative 0.1. This is extremely unique and a choice made by Japan's government to meet their specific needs. This was their attempt to overcome deflation, which was a big issue in Japan. By making interest rates negative, it makes it more economical to borrow and spend money than just holding on to it. As a result, people kept taking on loans because it was generating that money, and as a result, they started spending more, which stimulated Japan's economy. Now fiscal policy. Fiscal policy involves how governments use taxes and spending to influence the country's economy. By adjusting tax rates and government spending levels, governments aim to stimulate the economic growth during downturns, using expansionary fiscal policy, or control inflation during periods of high growth, using contractionary fiscal policy. So expansionary fiscal policy, similar to expansionary monetary policy, is when governments spend more money to increase the circulation of money within the circular flow of income, which creates jobs and more. Contractory fiscal policy is when governments increase interest rates to decrease the disposable income of people to reduce their spendings. An example of how governments can spend their money is through investments in military, investments in infrastructure, or investments in social programs, which stimulate the economy, and can be called injections. The ways they can influence tax rates are through increases or decreases in corporate tax, and increases or decreases in individual tax, like income rates. Fiscal policy, as we mentioned earlier, can be expansionary to promote spending, or contractionary to reduce spending. As you can assume, monetary policy, which is influenced by the central bank, is much more fast-acting than fiscal policy. Controlling interest rates is much faster than starting infrastructural projects, which can take years to see the effects of. Because interest rates can directly affect money circulation, they affect much faster. Whereas things like infrastructural projects, their benefits come from increased employment and injections into the economy in the form of available buildings where companies can relocate. This often takes time for companies to find these locations to relocate, and additionally, employment doesn't immediately increase the economy. In this section, we'll be going over ESG, or environment, social, and governance for short. ESG has become a topic of much concern in recent years especially, but has existed for hundreds of years and even beyond that. ESG is the social mission of a company, and integrating social aspects and objectives within a company's goals. However, there is an increasing demand for ESG in the investing process from investors and stakeholders alike. However, there is so much skepticism regarding the role of ESG and responsible investing. And the idea that focusing on ESG means compromising returns. However, this isn't the case. In this section, we'll be going over what ESG is, why it's so important, and how investors should take into consideration ESG not only advance social goals, but to ensure that their portfolios are profitable. Alright, so first, what is ESG? ESG, which stands for Environmental, Social, and Governments, is a comprehensive framework that evaluates a company's performance and practices in three key areas. The environmental aspect focuses on how a company interacts with the planet, from how it goes about carbon emissions, to managing resources, to addressing waste and pollution. The social aspect revolves around relationships, including how a company treats its employees, fosters diversity and inclusion, and engages with local communities through initiatives and philanthropy, and CSR. Finally, the governance aspect examines a company's internal structure, ethics, and accountability. This encompasses everything, from the composition of the board of directors, to ensuring transparency, integrity, and adherence to regulations. ESG is more than just a trend. It's a strategic approach that considers the broader impact of business activities on the environment, society, and ethical practices. So the origin of ESG. Although ESG has become much more well-known with people outside the investing landscape in recent years, it's existed for so long. The origins of ESG can be traced back to the mid-20th century, when discussions about corporate social responsibility started to take shape. However, it wasn't until the 1960s and 70s, fueled by social movements advocating for civil rights, that awareness of corporate impacts began to grow. This era saw the emergence of ethical investing, where investors excluded industries that conflicted with their own moral values. Global crises, including environmental disasters and financial meltdowns, further highlighted the urgent need for responsible business practices. In 2006, the United Nations took a significant step by launching the Principles for Responsible Investment, or PRI for short, signaling a formal commitment to integrating ESG considerations into investment decisions today. These historical milestones collectively paved the way for development and widespread adoption of ESG framework that we recognize today. Okay, so the importance of ESG. The significance of ESG lies in its ability to guide businesses towards long-term sustainability and success. By integrating environmental, social, and governance factors, companies not only reduce their environmental footprint, companies not only reduce their environmental footprint, but also foster innovation and adapt to changing landscapes. ESG practices aren't just about doing good, they're about managing risks effectively. Identifying potential environmental and social vulnerabilities can shield a company from future disruptions. Moreover, a robust ESG strategy enhances a company's reputation, building credibility and trust with stakeholders. This is especially crucial in an era where consumers and investors expect more than just financial returns. Beyond reputation, ESG practices ensure regulatory compliance as standards evolve, demonstrating a commitment to ethical conduct and transparency. In essence, ESG is more than just a buzzword. It's a strategic imperative that not only ensures businesses thrive, but also contribute positively to the world around them. So let's look at it in the modern investing lens. ESG has transformed the investment landscape by introducing a responsible approach to decision making. Investors now factor ESG considerations when crafting their portfolios and align their investments with ethical and sustainable values. It's not just about these values though, it's about potential financial benefits. ESG integration offers the promise of improved risk-adjusted returns, as companies with strong ESG practices often demonstrate resilience when faced with uncertainty. ESG-aligned companies also appeal to investors with a long-term outlook, as they prioritize sustainability in both environmental and self-sustainability and are better equipped to weather market fluctuations. Notably, research indicates that companies excelling in ESG can even outperform their peers financially. Beyond profit, ESG opens doors to impact investing, where investors actively contribute to positive societal and environmental changes through their investment choices. The integration of ESG factors signal a fundamental shift in how investors perceive value, emphasizing both financial returns and contributions to a more sustainable world. This is especially important in a modern world. With factors like social media, ESG has become even more important, and companies that fail to adopt ESG are placed under much more scrutiny as we'll see in future examples, compared to companies who do adopt ESG. The impact on stakeholders ESG doesn't just affect a company's internal practices, it extends to its relationship with stakeholders. Employees, for instance, are more engaged and satisfied when they work for a company that prioritizes their well-being and supports a positive workplace culture through ESG practices. Customers too are drawn to brands that align with their own values, and ESG provides that connection. Companies with strong ESG values tend to attract and retain socially conscious customers, thus strengthening brand loyalty. Beyond employees and customers, ESG initiatives have a positive ripple effect on their local communities, contributing to societal well-being and forging deeper community connections. Investors and other stakeholders also expect transparency and ethical conduct, making ESG an essential aspect of building trust. Ultimately, effective ESG practices manage not only a company's reputation, but also its relationship with the broader ecosystem that it operates within. The global impact of ESG As we said before, ESG is not limited to companies and not just communities either, and it has a significant effect on global outreach. By prioritizing environmental sustainability, ESG practices align with global objectives, such as mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity. On the social front, ESG initiatives address pressing challenges like poverty and inequality, contributing to a broader global development. The collaborative nature of ESG becomes evident through partnerships between companies, governments, and organizations across borders, all working together to address shared challenges. ESG encourages companies to innovate sustainably, develop solutions that can drive positive impacts on a global scale, and innovate more. So, as a financial investor, how do you assess a business's ESG? Now that we've established that ESG is important, how do we go about measuring it? Assessing a company's ESG performance involves evaluating its practices across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. ESG rating agencies play a pivotal role, providing scores based on established criteria that measure companies' alignment with ESG practices. In some sectors, specific ESG standards are in place, setting expectations for how companies should operate sustainably. As you can see on screen, there is something called the MSCI ESG rating, which is one of the ESG rating agencies. Additionally, transparency is key, as companies share their ESG data through reports disclosing their efforts and impacts. A critical aspect is materiality, which means focusing on the ESG factors most relevant to a company and its industry. This ensures that efforts are targeted where they matter most. ESG assessments serve as a dynamic tool for companies not just to measure their current performance, but to identify areas for growth and enhancement. So, how can businesses incorporate ESG? Incorporating ESG into business operations requires a nuanced and comprehensive approach. It starts with strong leadership commitment, with top management actively championing ESG principles. It can't just be an afterthought, it needs to be integrated into the core business strategy, along with the business principles and the business plan, which we discussed earlier. Stakeholder engagement is critical. Making employees, customers, and partners ensure that ESG initiatives align with their needs and concerns. To measure progress, establish clear ESG metrics and targets, or maybe consult ESG agencies. This helps hold companies accountable for their efforts. Additionally, awareness is key, so employees understand the significance of ESG and their role and its implementation. Innovation thrives when ESG goals are aligned, so companies should encourage research and development that supports sustainability. So ESG vs non-ESG stocks. Although we've clearly established that ESG does have benefits, how does it really help in reality? Theory isn't always right. So let's look at in reality. The choice between ESG and non-ESG stocks has had significant implications for investors. ESG-aligned companies tend to demonstrate better risk management and resilience against market turbulence, as we mentioned earlier. Research indicates that over the long term, ESG stocks can potentially outperform their non-ESG counterparts, driven by sustainable practices and responsible strategies. Moreover, as the demand for ethical and sustainable investments grow, especially in the modern world, ESG stocks could experience increased investor interest. ESG-aligned companies may also face fewer regulatory hurdles and reputational risks, making them more potentially stable choices. For example, they may not be affected by laws governing carbon taxes, and they may not have fit quotas which most companies that are non-ESG focused may fail to meet. Beyond just financial gains, investing in ESG stocks also aligns with broader trends in responsible investing and sustainable consumer behavior. So let's look at a mock situation and compare two companies, one which follows ESG practices and one that doesn't. The company that produces renewable energy has a strong track record of reducing carbon emissions and promoting clear energy. As a result, they have experienced steady growth driven by an increased demand for renewable energy sources and favorable regulatory policies which may reduce tax or provide subsidies. Additionally, they'll experience positive media, which can also help boost the company. On the other hand, a company which relies on fossil fuels will experience criticism for their environmental impact and negative media due to their contributions to climate change. As a result, their stock is likely to be volatile due to fluctuating oil prices in a dynamic market, changing that market dynamics, and growing concerns about environmental sustainability. As a result, in this situation, it's clear that the prior case is better when they use renewable energy. Additionally, let's look at a second example, but this time focusing on the social and governance aspects. In a diverse workplace, a company that promotes a gender and ethnic diversity and a workforce that represents a wide range of backgrounds is more likely to succeed than one that doesn't have these same practices. This is because employees are likely to be more motivated in the workplace and media is likely to show companies that focus on diversity in a positive light, whereas companies that don't focus are likely to face criticism. However, this is a nuanced approach. We need to look at reality, and in some cases, companies that don't have ESG principles in the moment may outperform those which do. However, in the long run, it's important to note that as the world becomes increasingly focused on social objectives, ESG will grow in importance, and as a result, non-ESG companies that may be in a better position now may not be in that same position in the future. So in this section, we'll just go over how to construct a portfolio and diversification, and the types of management, and the basics of how you construct a portfolio. So first of all, what is diversification? Diversification is essentially the process of purchasing assets from different asset classes to expand the number and type of securities in your portfolio. So if we look at this diagram, we can see here that on the x-axis, there's a number of securities, and on the y-axis, there's a standard deviation of your portfolio's return. The height represents the total risk, and as you can see, as the number of securities in your portfolio increases, the amount of unsystematic risk decreases, where a systematic risk persists, and we'll get to that in a bit. Essentially by purchasing more securities, you're going with the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket. And since you're spreading your risk over the portfolio by choosing companies in different sectors and industries, you're able to avoid your portfolio crashing if one of these things fails. Empirical evidence suggests that all it takes is about 30 to 40 different securities to achieve a fully diversified portfolio. Okay, so what are the types of risk? Well, there's systematic and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk is a market risk, which is non-diversable, which means you can get rid of it if you diversify, and it stems from market-wide risks. Unsystematic risks, on the other hand, are company or industry-specific risks that are inherent to a specific investment. Systematic risks are non-diversifiable, which means that they cannot get rid of. This is a risk that remains after efforts have been taken to diversify a portfolio. Systematic risk incorporates things like interest rate changes, inflation, recessions, and wars, among other major changes. Shifts in these things can affect the entire market and cannot be mitigated by changing positions within a portfolio of equities, because it affects every single equity. For example, the global financial crisis is a great example of systematic risk. Anyone who invested in the market in 2008 saw the values of their investment change drastically from this economic event. The Great Recession affected asset classes in different ways, as riskier securities, typically those that were leveraged more, were sold off in large quantities, whereas simpler assets like treasury bonds became more valuable. Unsystematic risk is a company or industry-specific risk that is inherent with each investment, and other systematic risks can be reduced by diversifying, as we've seen in this diagram. Systematic risks include things like inflation risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, and things like pandemics and war. Net risks are things like business risk, financial risk, default risk, and liquidity risk, which are specific to certain companies. So how do you measure your portfolio's performance? Well, the best way to do so is using benchmarks. A benchmark is a standard tool or measure that you can use to analyze the risk of a gear and portfolio. Individual funds and investment portfolios will typically have an established benchmark that you can already use for standard analysis to check your level of risk. Time-weighted vs. dollar-weighted returns Time-weighted returns are determined without regard to any subsequent cash flows from the investor. It measures the performance of the investment over a certain period of time, not the returns of the investor. Returns quoted by mutual funds and other investment managers are time-weighted because the portfolio manager doesn't have any control over future cash flows of investor dollars. In contrast, a dollar-weighted return considers subsequent contributions to and withdraws from an investment. For example, it considers timings and sales of purchases. A dollar-weighted approach focuses on the returns of the investor over a period of time, and this will usually differ from the time-weighted return. So how do you measure portfolio risk? Well, to measure risk, we need to identify what risk is. As we mentioned earlier, risk is the chance that a stock might fail, or the risk of volatility. So to measure risk, we would measure the chance that the performance of your portfolio as a whole would differ from the returns of the market or the benchmark portfolio. And the best way to calculate risk is using a standard deviation, which gives you returns over a given period. Standard deviation is the measure of dispersion of a set of data from its mean. It measures the absolute variability of a distribution. In essence, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the deviation from the mean. And this is the formula to calculate standard deviation. If any of you have taken statistics before, you'd be able to understand it. But if not, it's not necessary that you understand how to calculate standard deviation to actually employ it. You can use any online calculator to actually figure it out. So here is a standard deviation belt curve. Essentially the areas within the curve are more or the higher likely opportunities. So in this general area, 68.27% of opportunities will follow this. But as we go to the extremes, more and more situations will fall under the blanket. However, the rate at which it does so is diminishing. So active versus passive management. Passive investment strategies seek to replicate the constituents, weights, and therefore the risk and returns of a specific benchmark of index securities. It's a by-and-hold strategy that does not seek to pick winners and losers among the securities, but rather just hold them and see how things play out. The benefits of passive management include low fees, enhanced tax efficiency that stems from low portfolio turnover, and a limited portfolio management infrastructure, essentially meaning it's easier to manage yourself. The most popular use of vehicles for passive investment include index mutual funds and ETFs, or exchange traded funds. Active management, on the other hand, is based on the belief that risk-adjusted returns above the benchmark can be achieved through security selection, market timing, and sector rotations by highly skilled professional portfolio managers. Actually meaning you pick and choose stocks based on how you think they're going to do. Actively managed portfolios generally result in significant portfolio turnover as the manager reacts to market and temporary trends, either observed or forecasted. This high turnover combined with the costs to staff our portfolio and management team requires the manager to charge significantly higher fees than they would charge for a passively managed portfolio, and generally results in poor tax efficiency as frequent buying and selling of securities may result in something called a capital gains tax, which is essentially the tax you pay when you sell stocks. This capital gains tax is greater when you sell a stock within a period of less than a year, and it's less when you sell a stock that you've held for greater than a year. In the past, the S&P 500 has had significantly more success than actively traded portfolios. This has been occurring for the past 20 years, and you could replicate the index yourself. For example, you could buy all 500 stocks in the S&P 500 in the same proportion that they are in the S&P 500 index. But the issue with that is that you would have to constantly monitor the investments and buy and sell at the weights of these companies on the index. Some large institutional investors like pension funds do this, but it's more impractical for day to day investors like you and me. Especially when you look at just the S&P 500, when you look at things like the Russell 2000, it becomes even more impractical. For us, there are two options, index mutual funds and index ETFs, which are similar to mutual funds but trade continuously over the course of a day, like a stock. But in reality, it's not best to stick to either passive or active investment, or rather to do a hybrid form of management where you incorporate both aspects, some index and some active stocks. Let's look at Yale. Yale with their fixed income had an internal team to buy securities and bought a number of fixed assets and active assets to generate revenues. If you've looked at the news recently or in the past, you may have seen how active managers are outpacing things like the S&P 500. For example, Peter Lynch racked up a 29% return at Maglum fund from 1977 to 1990, including dividends, and he outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 13% a year during that time. However, his investing style was very lucrative during that period. And although some people may have praised him, we can introduce that to some extent luck was an important factor in his success. Although he did buy high quality companies that traded at a reasonable price, he wasn't able to do this for a consistent period of time, unlike what you would be able to do with investing in the S&P 500 for a longer period of time. So although certain stock pickers are able to beat funds like the S&P 500, it's a mistake to assume that this success will persist into the future. As a result, it's important to diversify your portfolio by also including stocks that are passive that you don't need to manage as much, and active funds as well. Now in this short section, after we've discussed all these financial investments, I want to talk to you about alternative investments. Throughout this course, we've talked about stocks, bonds, business strategy, the economy, financial documents, and so on. But there's so many different ways of investing beyond the traditional stocks and bonds that many people are limited to think are the only viable investment opportunities. As you will go about investing as a businessperson and as an individual, you'll come by opportunities to invest in non-conventional investments. Examples of these include real estate, equipment leasing, hedge funds, and in recent years things like cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It's important to realize these are viable investment opportunities, although they aren't as commonly used as stocks and bonds, although some can argue they are, they are alternative investments that can generate yields and profits if invested in appropriately. So this section is just to talk to you a little bit about what are these alternative investments and some of the characteristics of these alternative investments. So we've had the general investments like equity, private equity, and things like venture capital. Private equity being shares you've bought in a company, and venture capital being capital raised from venture capitalists who are people who are wealthy enough to invest in companies. But alternative investments like real estate include purchasing land or purchasing property. Equipment leasing can be when you lease equipment as a business, which can help you generate revenue when you aren't using equipment, hedge funds, which are a little bit more complicated, but they're similar to investing in a group of stocks, commodities or precious metals. Yes, you can invest in things like lithium or aluminum, cryptocurrencies and collectibles. So things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and so on, and NFTs. So what are some of the characteristics of these alternative investments? Well, if you look at real estate, for example, they're not very liquid. So illiquidity, which does increase risk. However, this varies from investment to investment. Additionally, they are sold by financial advisors or broker dealers, mostly to accredited investors. As a result, they aren't as easy to come by or as easy to invest in like stocks and bonds are. Additionally, they're to either public or private assets, but they're rarely publicly traded like stocks are on the stock market. Yeah, something to note is that these investments are high risk, high reward. So they are likely to skyrocket in price like we've seen with the cryptocurrency rises, but they're also likely to fall and cause you to lose a lot of money. So when you're investing in alternative investments, especially those with which you're not very well versed, make sure you make an informed decision and go about investing in a safe and ethical way so you don't miss out. All right, everyone, that's a wrap on this course. And just to summarize, we'll go through everything that we've learned. So we've learned about the time value of money, how a mortgage can rack up compound interest, things like how to identify if an investment is a good investment, the importance of capital markets at ESG, all relevant in business. We've also learned things like the business cycle, fiscal and monetary policy, and looked at case studies like Japan to understand the basics of economics. For finance, we've looked at the various financial documents, how to diversify your portfolio, how to mitigate risk and things, and the basics of statistics. Throughout this course, you realize that all of these three disciplines are highly interconnected, and you can study one without understanding the basics of some of the others. I'd like to say congratulations to all of you who have made it this far, and this knowledge will serve you well as you go into the future and explore these concepts in further depth. I'd like to remind you one more time that I do have a YouTube channel called changemakers media, which you'll see in the comment section. I post videos on teenagers who are making an impact in their local and international communities. I would greatly appreciate it if you guys could go down there and subscribe to show your support for these teenagers, and encourage these changemakers to continue impacting the world. That's it for me, everybody, thank you so much, I'll see you in the future, bye bye.",

        "Transcript": "Many of us want to become entrepreneurs. Starting your own business is one of the biggest dreams of our times. But how do you get to be an entrepreneur? Most of the advice focuses on the practicalities: writing a business plan, raising money, finding staff, marketing and PR. We'll go down a different route. In our eyes at the heart of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract: an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness. To be an entrepreneur means, essentially, to become an expert in the things that make life difficult for people. That's because every properly ambitious business is in some way trying to fix things for other people. And the bigger and more original what you're trying to fix happens to be, the more successful your business can be. Because consumer society is now well developed, it may be easy to think that all the big problems out there already have thousands of fixes anyway. Think of all those car companies, or pizza outlets, or news websites. We surely have enough of everything. What could we possibly add to what's already out there? But to get a sense of the vast opportunities that still remain in capitalism all you need to do is ask yourself: where and in what areas you're unhappy in the course of an average day? Every unhappiness is really a new business waiting to be born. Your frustrations are a nearly inexhaustible source of raw materials out of which the businesses of the future can be built. So while there may already be plenty of breakfast cereals, and t-shirts, and cell phones, and cab rides for sale, there's so much more that frustrates and depresses us: think of how difficult it is to get on with one's partner, educate children, cope with anxiety, discover what you want to do with your life, find a nice place to live, calm down in the evening. One could go on and on. Our griefs and irritations are endless, thankfully for the budding entrepreneurs. The biggest first step to take towards entrepreneurship is therefore to learn to study your own unhappiness and what might possibly heal it for you and others. When profits decline in businesses it's really the result of too many people throwing themselves at trying to fix the same area 'cause they can't think of anything more innovative to do rather than start a new airline, mobile phone company, or supermarket chain. And by contrast, healthy profits are a reward for understanding and mastering an area of human distress ahead of anyone else. Of course ideas aren't enough on their own; you need to take care of practicalities and money but they won't help you if your original psychological insight into human unhappiness isn't sound. And by the same token, if your insight into what makes people unhappy is razor sharp, and your solutions bold, then however difficult the journey, your business will stand a high chance of making money and benefiting humanity too.",

        "Transcript": "[MUSIC PLAYING] SPEAKER: Welcome back. Earlier in the\ncourse, you learned how digital marketing\nand e-commerce are continuing to change\nthe business landscape. You found out a little about\ncareers in these industries, including core skills,\nday-to-day responsibilities, job titles, and career paths. Finally, you considered some\nof the skills you already have that can help you\nadvance your career. Now it's time to\nexplore the ways that digital marketing and\ne-commerce create value for companies and\nfor their customers. In this part of\nthe course, you'll learn how companies use digital\nchannels to reach customers and explore foundational\nconcepts that can turn potential buyers\ninto loyal customers. Lastly, you'll learn why\nmeasuring marketing performance is so important to success. Digital marketing is constantly\ngrowing and changing. That's part of what makes it\nan exciting field to work in. But some things are\nalways important, like raising awareness,\nfostering trust, and building loyalty. The methods may change, but\nlearning the fundamentals can help you adapt and\ngrow along with the field. Are you ready? Let's get started. [MUSIC PLAYING] Did you know that over 60%\nof the global population is online? And more people are\njoining them every day. That's why every\nbusiness, big or small, needs an online presence\nto be competitive. But it's not enough\njust to have a website. There may be a lot\nof people online, but there's also\na lot of companies that want their attention\nand their business. Your target audience\nneeds to know you exist, how\nyou can help them, and what makes you different\nfrom the competition. Breaking through\nthis crowded field and actually reaching\npotential customers-- that's where digital\nmarketing comes in. Now, you might have noticed,\nI haven't mentioned anything about selling products yet. That's because digital\nmarketing is bigger than sales. It's not that selling products\nor services isn't important, but it's only one piece of\nwhat digital marketing can do for companies. Individual sales\nare easy to measure, but they don't mean much if your\ntarget audience doesn't trust your brand, or your\ncustomers don't come back for a second, third,\nor fourth purchase. A successful digital\nmarketing effort guides all of a company's\ncustomer interactions. It allows companies\nto think strategically about how to reach customers\nthrough digital channels before, during, and\nafter a purchase. It can be harder to measure\nthe value of these activities, but a well-coordinated\nstrategy allows businesses to thrive online and even grow. Let's think through an example. Imagine a company that\nmakes running shoes decides to invest in digital marketing. They create some video\nads and place them on a popular news site. They create accounts for\nseveral social media platforms and start posting content. But their posts don't\nget much engagement, and their ads don't\nattract many new customers. What's worse, they\ndon't even know why they aren't getting results. They've wasted time,\nmoney, and resources on a digital campaign\nthat doesn't work. Now, let's think about\nwhat could have happened if that same company\nmade an effort to learn about their audience. Instead of posting\nads on a news website, they targeted sites\nthat focused on running. Because they did\nresearch, they knew where to find their\nnew customers online. That knowledge also let\nthem create tailored content for their social media accounts\nthat reach the right audience. And because they\nresearched their audience, they were able to set meaningful\ngoals for their strategy. With clear goals in place,\nthey knew exactly how to measure their success. The information they\nmeasured allowed them to adjust their\ncustomer communication and improve their video,\nsocial, and email campaigns. They were able to\nrecognize opportunities to reach potential customers and\nengage with them effectively. Yes, sales went up, but their\nwell-planned digital strategy also built awareness,\ntrust, and loyalty. You'll learn more about how\nmarketers create and execute strategies like this one\nthroughout the program. For now, let's recap. Digital marketing is more than\nrunning ads to drive sales. It's a set of practices that\ncan affect a company's customer interactions at all levels\nand during every stage of the purchase journey. By learning about\ntheir customers, digital marketing teams can\nreach their target audience in a crowded online marketplace\nand nurture customer relationships over time. Coming up, you'll learn\nmore about the value digital marketing creates\nfor businesses and some of the challenges\nmarketing teams face when planning and\nexecuting strategies for online engagement. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back. So far, you've learned\nabout some of the things digital marketing\nand e-commerce can do for e-commerce businesses. You know the advantages\nof digital marketing and the challenges\nof reaching customers in a crowded online field. You also know that the\nfirst and most important step to any\nmarketing strategy is learning about your customers. Let's get deeper\ninto that last point. It's easy to think of a\nbusiness's marketing efforts as being all about them-- about ways to\nbring in customers, boost profits, or grow\ntheir online presence. But a really effective\nmarketing strategy starts with learning about\ncustomers' needs and pain points. Pain points are the\nspecific problems customers and potential\ncustomers want to solve. Instead of asking, how\ndo we sell more products, the most successful\nbusinesses want to know, how do we help\ncustomers address their pain points or achieve their goals. One is about the\ncompany's goals. The other is about\nthe customer journey. What is the customer journey? Well, think about the last\ntime you recommended something to a friend. It could be a product, like an\napp or a tool, or a service, like a restaurant\nor a contractor. Now, think about your journey\nwith that product or service. How did you first find it? If you had questions,\nhow did you get answers? What convinced you to try it? How did it help you solve a\nproblem or achieve a goal? And, finally, what made\nyou decide to recommend it to someone else? The path you take from learning\nabout that product to getting your questions answered\nto making your purchase is your customer journey. From your perspective,\nthe goal of that journey wasn't necessarily to\npurchase a specific product. It's just the thing that\nyou ended up purchasing happened to fulfill your needs. Here's an example. Let's pretend you're in the\nmarket for a new weather app. Maybe the one you\nhave isn't reliable, and you keep getting caught in\nthe rain without an umbrella. So you search online\nfor best weather apps and find some options. One stands out because\nthe name is familiar. You think a friend might have\ntold you about it recently, or maybe it was an online ad. You narrow your options\nto a few candidates and start reading reviews. Two have all the\nfeatures you want, but you pick the one\nwith the familiar name. It tops several\nbest-of lists, and it has a trial subscription. So you download the app,\nbut it's not working right. You go back to the reviews and\nfind out this is a known issue, so you contact the\nsupport through live chat. They help you fix\nthe problem quickly, which makes you feel\ngood about the company. You start the trial,\nand after a month, you've always had your\numbrella when it rained. You get an email reminder that\nyour trial is about to expire, and you're so happy\nwith the app that you purchase a subscription. Now you're a loyal customer. Each interaction with the brand\nduring this purchase journey is called a touchpoint. From the search to the customer\nreviews, online ad, trial subscription, live chat,\nand follow-up email, every touchpoint\nhad the potential to help or hurt your impression\nof the brand and its product. A bad experience at any point\ncan mean an abandoned journey, so it's in a company's\nbest interest to make sure you get\ninformation and answers you need along the way. With enough customer\nresearch, marketers can use these touchpoints to\ncreate a customer journey map. A customer journey\nmap is a visualization of the touchpoints a\ntypical customer encounters along their purchase journey. You can even have\nmultiple journey maps based on the patterns and\nbehaviors of different types of customers. Of course, it's impossible\nto know exactly what route each person will take. But journey maps aren't\nabout predicting the future. They help you understand how and\nwhy customers are interacting with your business. When you know how\ncustomers are finding you, how they're learning about\nyou, and what problems they want to solve, you can work to\nmake their experiences better. And better customer experiences\nultimately mean greater success for your business. And there you have it by. Understanding\ncustomer journeys, you can create better, more\nuser-friendly experiences. Coming up, you'll learn\nhow journey maps work along with another tool,\nthe marketing funnel, to target their\nmarketing efforts and encourage potential\ncustomers to make purchases. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now that you know about\ncustomer journey maps, it's time to introduce\na related concept-- the marketing funnel. The marketing funnel, also\ncalled the sales funnel or conversion funnel, is an idea\nthat's older than the internet. In fact, marketers have used\nit for over a hundred years. If it's been around\nthat long, it must be a pretty powerful tool. So what is a marketing\nfunnel, and how does it work? A marketing funnel is\na visual representation of the process\nthrough which people go from first learning\nabout a brand to becoming loyal customers. The funnel is wide at the top\nand narrows toward the bottom because a lot of\npotential customers will enter the top of the\nfunnel, but only some of them will reach the bottom to\nbecome loyal customers. Of course, people will drop\noff at every stage in between, so you want to make\nsure you're doing everything you can to keep\nthem moving through the funnel. There are a lot of different\nversions of the marketing funnel, and you'll learn\nabout a few of them later. Right now, I'm going\nto introduce you to a simple version of the\nfunnel that has four stages-- awareness, consideration,\nconversion, and loyalty. At the top of the funnel\nis the awareness stage. This is when a potential\ncustomer encounters a brand for the\nfirst time, maybe from an ad or a recommendation. At this stage, the\ncustomer probably doesn't know enough about that\ncompany to form an opinion. They're just aware it exists. Awareness is the widest\ntier because even though a lot of people\nmight know about a company, only some of them will think\nabout doing business with them. That's why it's important\nto raise as much awareness as possible among\ntarget audiences. A target audience is\nthe group of people most likely to purchase\na company's products. They're the ones whose attention\nyour digital marketing efforts should capture. Things start to narrow at the\nnext stage, consideration. This is when some potential\ncustomers from the awareness stage start to think about\ndoing business with a company. At this point, they could be\nactively browsing the website or comparing different brands. So making a good\nimpression is key. Those who move\nbeyond consideration go to the conversion stage. Conversion is when someone\ndecides to make a purchase and become a customer. To increase the\nchances of conversion, businesses should\ndemonstrate their value and provide a\nuser-friendly experience. The last stage is loyalty. It takes a huge amount of effort\nto move potential customers from awareness to conversion. So, once a customer\ncompletes a purchase, you want to give them\nreasons to return. Making current customers\nhappy can increase trust and keep them coming\nback for years to come. Now, if we're\nthinking that this all feels pretty similar to\na customer journey map, you'd be right. Marketing funnels and journey\nmaps are related concepts, and they're best\nwhen used together. Here's how they\ncomplement one another. First, you know that a journey\nmap traces a customer's path to purchase along\nspecific touchpoints. But a marketing funnel is part\nof a business's plan for moving customers along their journey. A journey map adopts the\ncustomer's perspective, but a funnel considers\nthat same process from the position\nof the business. Second, the structure\nof a marketing funnel is simpler than a journey map. Customer journeys are\ncomplex because they demonstrate how customers\nmight interact with a brand. Their paths to\npurchase are unique, and they can repeat or\nloop back on themselves. In contrast, the funnel\nis a linear model that breaks this journey\ninto broad stages. It's not about how specific\ncustomers reach consideration or conversion but\nwhat a company can do to move lots of customers\nfrom one stage to the next. Remember the\nweather app example? Let's think about a\nfew of the touchpoints our hypothetical\ncustomer encountered and how they might fit\ninto a marketing funnel. The customer was\nreminded of the app by the online ad\nin search results, making these\nawareness activities. The trial membership could\nbe a consideration offering, since it helped the customer\nlearn about the product. But it was the\nreminder email that finally got them to commit,\nso that's a conversion tactic. Funnels like this\none help businesses focus their goals and\nmarketing efforts, making their path from\nawareness to loyalty as smooth as possible. They drive engagement and make\nit more appealing for customers to do business with the company. When used together,\njourney maps and marketing funnels help\nmarketers understand and serve their customers\nbetter than either can alone. Let's review. Along with customer\njourney maps, a marketing funnel\nis a powerful tool that allows businesses\nto focus and coordinate their marketing efforts. To get the most out\nof a funnel, they should try to optimize\ntheir work at each stage. From awareness to consideration,\nconversion, and loyalty, a carefully planned funnel can\nhelp businesses succeed online. Coming up, we'll explore\na few different versions of the marketing\nfunnel and discuss how they evolve\nthrough commerce. Meet you there. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello again. Earlier in the\ncourse, we went over the concepts of the customer\njourney and the marketing funnel. Now, let's explore the funnel\nin a little more detail, starting at the top with the\nawareness and consideration stages. We'll consider\nsome of the things teams can do to get attention\nfrom potential customers and drive engagement\neffectively. First, awareness. You already know\nthat awareness is when a potential\ncustomer encounters your brand for the first time. This may seem like a simple\nidea, but how do you make sure your brand gets in front\nof the right audience? The first step is research. Finding out who your customers\nare and where they are online can help you focus\nyour marketing efforts in the right places. Getting to know your\nparticular audience allows you to pick the\nchannels that have the best chance of reaching them. There are a lot of\ndifferent tactics a business can use\nto reach customers. One way is to improve their\nrankings in search engine results. They can do this by\noptimizing website content around specific\nsearch terms or paying to place digital ads on\nwebsites, social media, email, or video platforms. Forming promotional\npartnerships with other brands or influencers can also\nhelp raise awareness. You'll learn more about\neach of these tactics later in the program. For now, just remember that a\nstrong top-of-funnel marketing strategy takes advantage\nof multiple channels and creates a consistent\nexperience across all of them. It's also important to\nkeep in mind that awareness isn't a one-time event. Once someone knows\nabout your business, it can take days, weeks,\nor even longer for them to get to the\nconsideration stage. So once you've reached\na potential customer, the goal is to get\nthem to remember you. Say your company\nsells refrigerators. That's a big purchase and not\none that you make everyday. So even if a potential customer\nknows about your business, they might wait until their\nold fridge breaks to start thinking about a new one. Maintaining a consistent\nonline presence can remind them that you\nexist when the time is right. That way, they'll\nthink of your business when they do need your services. Now let's move on\nto consideration. You know that consideration is\nthe getting-to-know-you stage. It's when people start\nexploring your business and finding out what makes you\ndifferent from the competition. During this stage, the goal\nis to increase the chances that a potential customer will\neventually make a purchase. They might be reading\nonline reviews or actively browsing\nyour website by now, so you need to give them\nreasons to stick around or to come back if\nthey've already left. At this stage, some potential\ncustomers will become leads. A lead is a potential\ncustomer who has interacted with\nthe brand and shared personal information,\nlike an email address. Let's take that\nrefrigerator example again. Imagine that customer goes\nto your website and checks out a few different\nmodels, but they don't make a decision right away. Maybe they need more\ntime to think about it or want to compare\ndifferent brands. Or they could have\njust gotten distracted. You can engage that\nperson again by serving them ads based on the products\nand pages they visited. That makes it more\nlikely they'll return to make a purchase. Once a potential\ncustomer is on your site, you should aim to educate\nthem about your offerings and explain how specific\nproducts or services address their pain points. That can mean offering\nengaging, useful content, like blog posts,\nnewsletters, or webinars. Free samples, tools,\nor trial memberships can let potential customers\ntest out your services before committing. The goal is to\nstart building trust in the quality of\nyour products and give customers what they need\nto make an informed choice. To recap, the top of the funnel\nboosts awareness and customer engagement. At the awareness\nstage, marketers use a variety of\ntools and channels to connect with\npotential customers and stay fresh in their minds. During the consideration\nstage, they should make it clear\nwhat they're offering and how they can meet\ncustomers' needs. When executed carefully,\nawareness and consideration tactics can lead to more people\neventually becoming customers. Coming up, you'll learn\nmore about marketing funnels and discover some ways\nto measure awareness and consideration success. [MUSIC PLAYING] So far, you've learned\nabout some ways to raise awareness and engage\nwith potential customers. You know that selecting\nthe right channels to reach a target\naudience is one of the most important\nthings businesses can do to market\nproducts online. But we haven't gotten to\nthe most important part. How do you know if the tactics\nyou've chosen are working? Are there ways to improve on\nwhat you're already doing? Or do you need to start\nagain with a whole new plan? To answer all of these\nquestions is measurement. The fact is, no matter\nhow much research you do or how carefully you plan a\nmarketing strategy, none of it matters unless you can\nmeasure your success. Measuring outcomes at\neach stage of the funnel allows you to find out\nwhat you're doing right, what you're doing wrong,\nand where you can improve. In this video, we'll discuss\nsome of the metrics companies use to measure success\nat the top of the funnel. A metric is a\nquantifiable measurement used to track and assess\nprogress toward an objective. Marketing metrics can\ngauge different aspects of campaign performance\nand effectiveness, which can help businesses make\nimprovements for the future. For example, to measure\nawareness of their ads, marketers use tools to track\nthings like impressions, reach, and frequency. Impressions are the total\nnumber of times an ad appears on people's screens. That number includes\nusers who encounter the ad more than once. So if an ad is encountered\n200 times by 100 people, the number of impressions\nis 200 since it's been shown 200 times. In contrast, reach is the total\nnumber of unique individuals who encounter an ad across\ntheir different devices. No matter how many times\na person gets that ad, they're only counted once. So the reach of an ad\nthat's encountered 200 times by 100 people would be 100. Frequency refers\nto how many times each individual encounters\nthe ad in a given time frame. So if each of those 100 people\ngets the ad twice in a week, the frequency would be 2. These are just a\nfew of the metrics you can use to gauge awareness. You'll learn more about\ntracking and analyzing awareness measurements\nlater on in the program. The goal of the awareness\nstage is usually to get ads in front of the\nright people at the right times. By analyzing impressions,\nreach, and frequency, marketers can find out\nhow big of an impact their ads are having. If the numbers are below the\ncompany's goal for awareness, they may decide to\nreevaluate their ad strategy. But businesses can also have\nmore specific awareness goals, like getting a certain\namount of visitors to a page on a website. Exactly what you\nchoose to measure depends on what you're\ntrying to achieve. That's why it's\nimportant to set goals for each stage of the funnel. At the consideration\nstage, there are different ways\nto measure success, but they all come\ndown to one idea-- engagement. How much, how often,\nand for how long are potential customers\nengaging with your content? Analytics tools can track things\nlike how often customers search for your business online, the\nnumber of first-time visitors to a site, the number\nof pages per visitor, and how long visitors\nspend on a page. Signing up for\nemails or newsletters is another good\nmeasurement of engagement. And getting customer\ncontact information will make it easier to remind\nthem you exist and demonstrate your value later on. It may seem more\nengagement is better, but that isn't always the case. If the goal is for customers\nto find what they need quickly, but customers spend a long\ntime completing tasks, it may mean you\nneed to reevaluate the layout of your website. Measuring website interactions\ncan give you a lot of insights, so knowing which\nnumbers are important and what they mean for\nyour goals is crucial. Even with clear goals\nand accurate information, measuring awareness and\nengagement is often more challenging than measuring\nbottom-of-the-funnel concerns like sales. Later in the\nprogram, you'll learn how to interpret this\nkind of information and how businesses\nuse it to improve their tactics for moving\nleads from consideration to conversion. Let's review. Measuring awareness\nand engagement is the most important thing\nbrands can do to ensure success at the top of the funnel. Marketing teams use analytics\ntools to measure awareness through numbers of impressions,\nreach, and frequency. Consideration can be measured\nthrough website engagement, including page visits, detailed\nviews, and email signups. Knowing what to measure in\norder to reach your goals is an important part\nof marketing success. Coming up, you'll learn\nmore about the funnel and what to do at the\nconversion and loyalty stages. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back. In the last lesson, we covered\nthe awareness and consideration stages of the marketing funnel. We discussed some of\nthe things businesses should do and measure to raise\nawareness and boost customer engagement. Now let's get into the\nconversion and loyalty stages of the funnel. We'll consider what teams can\ndo to drive sales and keep customers coming\nback again and again. You know that the\nconversion stage, also known as the decision\nor purchase stage, is when someone makes a\npurchase and becomes a customer. Not everyone who considers\na purchase will convert, and potential customers\nmake purchases when they think that one\ncompany solution fits their needs better than others. So it's essential that\nthey do everything they can do to demonstrate and\ndeliver value at this stage. You want customers to trust\nyou and feel confident in their decision\nto buy your product. The goal of the conversion\nstage is simple. It's to turn potential\ncustomers into buyers. But how different companies\ngo about making that happen depends on their\nproducts and audience. It's also important to keep in\nmind that different customers can get from consideration\nto conversion through different touchpoints. But it is possible to identify\ntrends in customer behavior, so you can personalize content\nand improve target areas. You'll find more about\nidentifying these trends later in the program. To set themselves apart\nat the conversion stage, businesses should provide\nclear and useful content and experiences. That includes everything from\naccurate product descriptions to a smooth checkout process\nand a clear returns policy. Well-placed product-focused ads\nand a clearly organized website can be persuasive too. Whatever the methods,\nmaking it easy for leads to find answers\nand take action makes conversion more likely. Now, some marketing funnels\nend after the customer makes a purchase, but building and\nmaintaining customer loyalty can be just as important\nas converting them in the first place. Successful businesses\nbalance customer acquisition with retention because\nonce you've made the effort to build a relationship\nwith a customer, you want to keep that\nrelationship going. Customer loyalty\ndepends foremost on the quality and\nvalue of your product. But even if a customer\nloves their purchase, that's no guarantee\nthey'll come back for more. Building loyalty is about\ncreating a great customer experience during\nand after purchase. Many companies use things\nlike follow-up emails, rewards programs, or social\nmedia engagement to nurture relationships with\ncustomers on an ongoing basis. Those interactions should always\nbe purposeful and thoughtful. For example, email coupons can\nencourage repeat purchases. But sending a coupon for\nsomething a customer just bought? They probably won't be\ntoo happy about that. When companies focus on creating\na positive post-purchase experience, they can\ndrive future sales and win customers who aren't\njust brand loyal but devoted fans, and that's it. Let's review. At the bottom of the\nfunnel, businesses focus on converting\npotential customers and encouraging those customers\nto return in the future. During the conversion\nstage, they demonstrate value\nthrough quality content and experiences. After a purchase,\nthey build loyalty by continuing to engage\ncustomers and build relationships. By optimizing these\nresults at each stage, businesses can thrive in a\ncrowded online marketplace. Coming up, you'll review what\nyou learn about marketing funnels so far and\nfind out some things businesses can do\nto measure success at the bottom of the funnel. Meet you there. [MUSIC PLAYING] By now, you've learned a lot\nabout the marketing funnel and how businesses use it\nto raise awareness, increase consideration, encourage\nconversion, and build loyalty. You know some of the\nthings they measure at the top of the\nfunnel and understand why tracking this information\nis key to success. In this video, we'll explore\nsome ways to measure success at the bottom of the funnel\nin the conversion and loyalty stages. Let's go. The most basic thing you can\nmeasure at the conversion stage is the number of conversions. A conversion happens\nwhen a potential customer takes a desired action,\nin this case, when they make a purchase. Seem simple, right? The number of conversions\nis crucial information, but it's not the only thing\nyou can measure at this stage. Tracking time to\nconversion, cost per conversion, the average\nnumber of touchpoints before conversion, or\nthe average order size can provide valuable\ninsights into how customers interact with your brand. These insights also allow you\nto address drop-off issues, like abandoned carts. Cart abandonment\nis when a customer adds an item to their cart but\ndoesn't complete the purchase. Believe it or not, it's\nestimated that nearly 70% of online carts are abandoned. So finding out where customers\ndrop off in the checkout process can help you improve\nprocedures and increase your conversions. OK, it's time for the\nlast stage of the funnel-- loyalty. How a business chooses\nto measure loyalty depends on their target\naudience and particular goals. Some common things\nto measure include the rate of repeat\npurchases, the length of time between purchases, the\nnumber of orders per customer, and the rate of account\nactivation after signup. The level of engagement\nwith rewards programs is also another indicator of\ncustomer loyalty over time. Loyalty metrics allow businesses\nto assess and refine strategies to keep customers, boost\nsales, and save money. But they also reveal where\nthey can manage customer relationships more effectively. In the end, customer\nloyalty is the truest test of how well the entire funnel\nserves customers and meets their needs. We'll get further into\nhow conversion and loyalty measurements are used\nlater in the program. For now, just remember,\nbeyond completed purchases, conversion measurements also\ntrack behaviors, like time to conversion and order size. These measurements provide\nvaluable information that can enable teams to curb\ndrop-offs and increase sales. Loyalty measurements track\nthings like account activation, time between purchases,\nand orders per customer. By measuring loyalty, businesses\ncan improve retention rates and build revenue over time. And there you go. Measuring results\nthroughout the funnel is the best tool brands\ncan use to optimize their effort at each stage. And a well-planned\nfunnel means they can nurture leads effectively\nthroughout their purchase journeys. Coming up, you will\nexplore some ideas of where the e-commerce industry\nmight be headed in the future.

        "Transcript": "you can't really fail at it unless you buy the wrong stock or just get excited at the wrong time and i would like to just spend just a couple of minutes uh giving you a little perspective uh on how you might think about about uh investments as opposed to the uh tendency to focus on what's happening today or even this minute as you go through and to help me in doing that i'd like to go back through a little personal history and uh and we will start i have here up here in new york times of march 12 1942 and i'm a little behind on my reading and if you go back to that time it it was about what just about three months um since we got involved in a war which uh we were losing at that point uh the newspaper headlines were filled with bad news from the pacific and i've taken just a couple of the headlines from the days preceding march 11th which i'll explain it's kind of a momentous day for me and so you can see these headlines we've got slide 2 up there i believe and uh we were in trouble big trouble in the pacific uh it was only going to be a couple months later that the philippines fell but here we were getting bad news we might go to slide three for march 9th uh uh i hope you can read the headlines anyway the price of the paper is three cents incidentally um the uh and uh uh let's see we've got march 10th up there a slide i'm i want to get to where there's advanced technology of slides i want to make sure i'm showing you the same thing that i'm seeing in front of me so anyway on march 10th uh when again the news was bad full clearing path to australia and it was like it the stock market had been reflecting this and i'd been watching a stock called city service preferred stock which had sold at 84 dollars the previous year it had sold at 55 the year before early in the in january two months earlier and now it was down to forty dollars on march 10th so that night despite these headlines i said to my dad i said i think i'd like to pull the trigger and i'd like you to uh buy me three three shares of city certified the next day and that was all i had i mean that was my capital accumulated uh uh over the previous five years or thereabouts and so my dad the next morning um bought three shares well let's take a look at what happened the next day let's go to the next slide please and it was not a good day the stock market the dow jones industrials broke 100 on the downside now they were down 2.28 as you see but that was the equivalent of about a 500 point drop now so i'm in school wondering what is going on of course uh incidentally you'll see on the left side of the chart the new york times put the dow jones industrial average below all the averages they calculated they had their own averages which have since disappeared but the dow jones has continued so the next day uh we can go to the next slide and you will see what happened the stock that was in 39 my dad bought my stock right away in the morning because i'd asked him to my three shares and uh so i paid the high for the day that 38 and a quarter uh was my tick which is the high for day and by the end of the day it was down to 37 uh which was really kind of characteristic of my timing in stocks that was going to appear in future years uh um but uh uh it was on the what was then called the new york curb exchange then became the american stock exchange but things even though the war until the battle of midway looked very bad and if you'll turn to the next slide please you'll see that the stock did rather well you can see where i bought at 38 and a quarter and then the stock went on actually to eventually be called by the city service company for over 200 dollars a share but this is not a happy story because if you go to the next page you will see that i well as they always say it seemed like a good idea at the time you know uh so i sold those i made five dollars on it it was it was again typical of behavior but when you watch you go down to 27 uh you know it looked pretty good to get that profit well what's the point of all this well we can leave behind the city service story and i would like you to again imagine yourself back on march 11th of 1942 and as i say things were looking bad in the european theater as well as what was going on in in the pacific but everybody in this country knew uh america was going to win the war i mean it it was you know we'd gotten blindsided but but we were we were going to win the war and and we knew that the american system had been working well since 1776. so if you'll turn to the next slide i'd like you to imagine that at that time uh you had invested ten thousand dollars and you put that money in an index fund we didn't have index funds then but but you in effect bought the s p 500 now i would like you to think a while and don't do not change the slide here for a minute i'd like you to think about how much that 10 000 would now be worth if you just had one basic premise just like in buying a farm you buy it to hold throughout your lifetime an independent and you look to the output of the farm to determine whether you made a wise investment you look to the output of the apartment house to decide whether you made a wise investment if you buy an apartment small apartment house to hold for your life and let's say instead you decided to put the ten thousand dollars in and hold a piece of american business uh and never look at another stock quote never listen to another person give you advice or anything of the sort i want you to think how much money you might have now and now that you've got a number in your head let's go to the next slide and we'll get the answer you'd have 51 million dollars and you wouldn't have had to do anything you wouldn't have to understand accounting you wouldn't have to look at your quotations every day like i did that first day i'd already lost 3.75 by the time i came home from school uh all you had to do was figure that america was going to do well over time that we would overcome the current difficulties and that if america did well american business would do well you didn't have to pick out winning stocks you didn't have to pick out a winning time or anything of the sort you basically just had to make one investment decision in your life and that wasn't the only time to do it i mean i could go back and pick other times that uh would work out even greater gains but as you listen to the questions and answers we give today just remember that the over the overriding question is how is american business going to do over your investing lifetime uh i would like to make one other comment because it's it's a little bit interesting let's let's say you're taking that ten thousand dollars and you listen to the profits of doom and gloom around you and and you'll get that constantly throughout your life and instead you use the ten thousand dollars to buy gold now for your ten thousand dollars you would have been able to buy about 300 ounces of gold and while the businesses were reinvesting uh in more plants and new inventions came along you would go down every year into your look in your safe deposit box and you'd have your three ounce 100 ounces of gold and you could look at it and you could fondle it and you could i mean whatever you wanted to do with it but it didn't produce anything it was never going to produce anything and what would you have today you would have 300 ounces of gold just like you had in march of 1942 and it would be worth approximately four hundred thousand dollars so if you decided to go with a non-productive asset goal instead of a productive asset which actually was earning more money and reinvesting and paying dividends and maybe purchasing stock whatever it might be you would now have over 100 times uh the value of what you would have had with a non-productive asset in other words for every dollar you have made in american business you'd have less than a penny by of gain by buying in the store value which people tell you to run to every time you get scared by the headlines or something disorder it's it's just remarkable uh to me that we have operated in this country with the greatest tailwind at our back that you can imagine it's an investor's i mean you can't really fail at it unless you buy the wrong stock or just get excited at the wrong time but if you if you owned a cross-section of america and you put your money in consistently over the years there's just there's no comparison against owning something that's going to produce nothing and there frankly there's no comparison with trying to jump in and out of stocks and and pay investment advisors if you'd followed my advice incidentally or this retrospective advice which is always so easy to give uh if you'd follow that of course you're there's one problem buddy your your friendly stock broker would have starved to death i mean you know and you could have gone to the funeral to atone for their fate but the truth is you would have been better off doing this than than a very very very high percentage of investment professionals have done or people have done that are active that it's it's very hard to move around successfully and beat really what can be done uh with a very relaxed philosophy and you do not have to be you do not have to be you do not have to know as much about accounting or stock market terminology or whatever else it may be or what the fed is going to do next time and whether it's going to raise rates three times or four times or two times none of that counts at all really in a lifetime of investing what what counts is is having a a philosophy that you've that you stick with that you understand why you're in it and then you forget about doing things that you don't know how to do",

We see more homes in the market, according to experts at Zillow like Mark Bavaro, during 2025, more single family homes will enter the market than we've seen in the last five decades. But why? During the pandemic, there was a huge boom from construction companies on making new homes. Those homes are finalized and are going to be hitting the market in 2025, according to Zillow Predictions. Buyers will be looking for smaller properties, a stark shift from what we saw during the pandemic when they wanted spacious homes, people were looking to more cozy places. They wanted to access that first home and the square meters and these gigantic open floor plans were not as needed as in the years, like right after the pandemic. As for the South Florida market, they expect prices to continue rising for Miami in 2025. Is that the prices of homes will go up by 4%. So for home owners, they will continue to see that that investment continues to go up. Aside from the migration we've seen from other states, Zillow experts say a new generation of buyers will impact prices. Millennials, who are the largest segment of the market that is looking for a home. Bavaro predicts they will create pressure on prices, and those prices will most likely rise. If you're thinking of buying a home, Zillow says you should hire a real estate agent who can guide you. Plan well to see how much you can really spend. Zillow has a tool in their app called viability that helps you determine that. They also recommend knowing the area you are buying in well, including the weather risks you could face.

        "Transcript": "Hello friends I'm Tim Mayer your wealth manager with Primo May Financial you might be wondering what is wealth management well that's a very good question folks let's run through seven pillars of wealth management then I'll give you a good working definition at the end now in my next video I'll point out three outcomes that you should expect from engaging this wealth management process I'll describe before I do that I'd like you to subscribe to this Channel and hit the Bell so you're notified of all the great videos we have in production right now on all aspects of wealth management and the financial questions that you wish you could ask someone like me okay Seven Pillars of wealth management let me start by saying this there are even more facets of wealth management and this list of seven is really just the fundamentals I could talk all day about the subject but we'll save that for another uh video or two or a 100 down the road our first pillar of wealth management is fin financial planning this is really the foundation financial planning describes getting down to a real clear understanding of the client's Current financial situation identifying their goals their dreams and concerns and then mapping out how to get from here to there this can involve quite a bit of data Gathering such as incomes expenses account balances and other assets and debts as well at this stage we're essentially building and refining the client's income statement and balance sheet then forecasting how things will shake out in the years to come both before and after implementing our proposed recommendations a second pillar is retirement income planning as we look carefully at the client's Current financial picture a natural qu question arises how can this client retire and not run out of money in fact I would say this is probably the biggest question on the minds of people who visit our office for a consultation the transition from earning an income to spending savings for decades takes a lot of planning to make sure the client feels very comfortable that he or she isn't going to run the gas tank dry in their later years we do this for them by carefully mapping income and expenses then cover income gaps with projected distributions from optimal savings buckets a third pillar of wealth management is Investment Management no doubt this is what most of my colleagues or competitors in the financial World gravitate towards often times to the neglect of other key pillars this one is all about identifying the appropriate investment Holdings for the client based on their desired outcomes as well as their current situation and risk tolerance part of my job is to understand what my client's risk capacity is that is how much risk they can afford to take while investing as well as the risk appetite which is more about the balance between their personal Zeal for performance versus concerns about significant losses and volatility investment management is taking the results of this wealth management process and then applying it to ongoing review and selection of Investments for the most efficient results relative to the client's goals a fourth pillar is tax optimization folks I don't know if you realize this but this moment we're experiencing right now is historic for its relatively low tax rates a significantly important part of comprehensive wealth management is to review current and future tax rates to look for opportunities for improvement to a client's lifetime taxation this could include filling up a bracket Roth conversions enhanced tax Management on an Investment Portfolio and a number of other strategies Everyone likes to see good performance on their portfolio but if the IRS is a major stakeholder in your taxable accounts reducing the overall taxation can have a really outsized effect on long-term performance a fifth pillar of wealth management is Insurance planning I've never run into anyone who enjoys paying for insurance but I've known quite a few people in my time who have enjoyed the benefits of making Smart Insurance decisions no widow or dis uh disabled worker came back to me saying they wish the check from the insurance company had been smaller a great wealth management plan will examine current Insurance coverages identify serious gaps and find the right strategy to get the protection needed a sixth pillar is risk management this ties in closely not only with insurance planning but also with Investment Management retirement planning and tax optimization your wealth manager role is to understand you the client so well that they can identify the risks to your financial Wellness as well as assess the risks by which would be so catastrophic that they need to be addressed no matter what which would be uncomfortable and should be mitigated or avoided when possible and which are negligible enough that you can live with it risk is a part of life it's as multifaceted as life itself and managing its effect on financial Wellness is a critical task and finally a seventh pillar of wealth management is estate planning this pillar is all about thinking through and crafting a comprehensive plan to preserve and distribute your assets according to your wishes both during your life and afterwards while minimizing potential taxes and ensuring a smooth transition to your heirs estate planning is about the transmission not only of dollars but of values to those you care about really it's the Capstone of your wealth story and planning ahead can not only give you peace of mind but also help you take advantage of opportunities to magnify your desired outcomes after this life is over so there's seven pillars of wealth management now to distill it into a working definition for you wealth management is an ongoing comprehensive process of assessing directing and enhancing the desired outcomes of a client's Financial life for our firm it comes down to stewardship on behalf of our clients to whom were personally committed for their financial Wellness if you'd like to know more about how we carry out this process of weal management for our

than the admissions\u00a0\u00a0 rate of a top university like harvard or stanford\u00a0\nstartup fundraising can seem like an intimidating\u00a0\u00a0 opaque and unfair process in this video\u00a0\ni'll try to demystify that process and\u00a0\u00a0 talk about how to successfully\u00a0\nraise money for your startup\u00a0\u00a0 i'll answer common questions like whether you\u00a0\nshould raise venture capital when's the best\u00a0\u00a0 time to do so pitch deck tips finding the right\u00a0\ninvestors and what to do once you get an offer hi i'm wayne i've been a venture capitalist\u00a0\nfor about seven years starting by interning\u00a0\u00a0 at one of the oldest and most storied venture\u00a0\nfunds kleiner perkins and today i'm a partner\u00a0\u00a0 at signalfire which is a new king on the block\u00a0\nbillionaire venture fund built using technology\u00a0\u00a0 like the startups that we invest in over the last\u00a0\ndecade i've been lucky enough to have met with\u00a0\u00a0 thousands of founders many of whom have gone on to\u00a0\nraise hundreds of millions in venture capital and\u00a0\u00a0 in that time i've learned a few things about\u00a0\nfundraising and what works and what doesn't a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of this is tribal knowledge that's not\u00a0\nwidely understood and as someone who is an\u00a0\u00a0 outsider to silicon valley for many years my hope\u00a0\nis to level the playing field as much as i can\u00a0\u00a0 as a general principle you should try to get\u00a0\nas far as you can without money most investors\u00a0\u00a0 are looking for as much traction as possible and\u00a0\nwilling to pay for it both because they want to\u00a0\u00a0 back the company that's least risky furthest along\u00a0\nand most likely to be the winner in a market but\u00a0\u00a0 also because it shows you can execute with limited\u00a0\nresources which is arguably the very essence of\u00a0\u00a0 entrepreneurship from the founder's standpoint\u00a0\ntaking venture capital comes with strings attached\u00a0\u00a0 you're signing up for rapid growth expectations\u00a0\nand pressure to spend aggressively to hit the\u00a0\u00a0 next set of milestones you need to raise yet more\u00a0\nventure capital that's a treadmill you need to be\u00a0\u00a0 sure your business is ready for and as you think\u00a0\nabout timing a valuable exercise is to list out\u00a0\u00a0 all the hypotheses that need to be proven true\u00a0\nfor your future vision of the world to materialize\u00a0\u00a0 maybe you need to prove there's some new\u00a0\ntechnology that works the way you think\u00a0\u00a0 or that consumers are willing to come back\u00a0\nand use your product on a repeated basis\u00a0\u00a0 or they can deliver that product in a cost\u00a0\neffective way you can create much more specific\u00a0\u00a0 hypotheses for your company and then one by one\u00a0\nfigure out how to test and de-risk some of them\u00a0\u00a0 without money investors want to see evidence you\u00a0\ncan be scrappy in testing those ideas and learning\u00a0\u00a0 quickly one thing i hear often is this notion that\u00a0\nyou need to raise money so you can hire and pay\u00a0\u00a0 co-founders arguably the single most important\u00a0\nthing you're going to need to do as a founder\u00a0\u00a0 is recruit your core team including a technical\u00a0\nco-founder needs to be in place when you pitch\u00a0\u00a0 vcs they're going to be looking for evidence\u00a0\nthat you can recruit top-notch talent like that\u00a0\u00a0 google engineer who could be making 200 grand\u00a0\nat google not by throwing money at them but by\u00a0\u00a0 convincing them in the value of your company's\u00a0\nfuture worth and therefore equity now there are\u00a0\u00a0 things that money can accelerate and that's why\u00a0\nmost successful tech companies do raise eventually\u00a0\u00a0 but remember that you should aspire to de-risk as\u00a0\nmuch of your business as you can without money and\u00a0\u00a0 if your business is seasonal like say education\u00a0\nsoftware that sells like hot kicks at the\u00a0\u00a0 beginning of the school year then that's the best\u00a0\ntime to raise your round more generally you want\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that you have a strong case you're at\u00a0\nan inflection point in your growth and it's really\u00a0\u00a0 important that you understand from investors what\u00a0\nmilestones they're expecting from your specific\u00a0\u00a0 company and stage even if you hit venture fundable\u00a0\nmilestones you have to plan for a fundraising\u00a0\u00a0 process that could take you three or even six\u00a0\nmonths from first pitch to money actually hitting\u00a0\u00a0 your bank account that encompasses everything from\u00a0\npreparing for a fundraise which could take a month\u00a0\u00a0 to actually finding a meeting investors and\u00a0\nworking with them through a diligence process\u00a0\u00a0 which could take several months to finally\u00a0\nclosing a round which could take a month itself\u00a0\u00a0 and during that time you ideally want to\u00a0\ndedicate 100 of your attention to fundraising\u00a0\u00a0 so you can get it out of the way and back\u00a0\nto building as soon as possible and lastly\u00a0\u00a0 remember to plan around holidays it sounds silly\u00a0\nbut a lot of venture capitalists go on vacation\u00a0\u00a0 so there's two lulls during the year in the month\u00a0\nof july and starting around mid-november through\u00a0\u00a0 the beginning of january where it can be really\u00a0\nhard to schedule meetings and you can lose steam\u00a0\u00a0 okay so now you decided to raise venture capital\u00a0\nlet's talk about the process the first step is to\u00a0\u00a0 create your sales pitch for your startup typically\u00a0\nin the form of a powerpoint deck keep it simple\u00a0\u00a0 10 to 15 slides max that covers the basics and\u00a0\nsave the details for in-person meetings most\u00a0\u00a0 pitches generally follow the same structure like\u00a0\nthe templates i'll link in the description below\u00a0\u00a0 you need to cover who you are and why you and your\u00a0\nteam are uniquely suited to build this specific\u00a0\u00a0 startup what's the problem you're addressing\u00a0\nand why that means it's an enormous market\u00a0\u00a0 how are you going to solve the problem in a\u00a0\nway that's 10 times better than the competition\u00a0\u00a0 how do you make money very profitably one day\u00a0\nwhat have you done so far to de-risk the business\u00a0\u00a0 how you're differentiated from competitors\u00a0\nand then how much money you're raising and\u00a0\u00a0 what milestones are you gonna hit with that\u00a0\nmoney it's not enough to just check the boxes\u00a0\u00a0 you need to weave everything together in a\u00a0\ncompelling story that feels authentic to you\u00a0\u00a0 and emphasizes your strengths while proactively\u00a0\naddressing the key risks and common questions you\u00a0\u00a0 know vcs are going to ask and remember that at the\u00a0\nend of the day your goal is to convince investors\u00a0\u00a0 you have an unfair advantage in unlocking an unmet\u00a0\nbillionaire market opportunity quick tip treat\u00a0\u00a0 your pitch deck like a base template and customize\u00a0\nit have a short teaser deck cutting out any\u00a0\u00a0 sensitive information that you can send over email\u00a0\nand a more in-depth deck for in-person meetings\u00a0\u00a0 which you can adapt for your audience you should\u00a0\nbe lasered in on understanding what specific\u00a0\u00a0 questions each vc cares about and then shape\u00a0\nyour content accordingly another common concern\u00a0\u00a0 founders have here is just sharing their secret\u00a0\nsauce with vcs don't ask a vc to sign an nda\u00a0\u00a0 vcc thousands of decks per year and if they sign\u00a0\nan nda to see all of them it'd be impossible to\u00a0\u00a0 keep track of and in any case the ideas themselves\u00a0\nwhile important are meaningless without execution\u00a0\u00a0 next you need to make a target list of investors\u00a0\nthat you want to speak to you want to find\u00a0\u00a0 partners that can lead rounds at your stage are\u00a0\nbullish about your sector and will be good value\u00a0\u00a0 add partners to you there's so many free tools out\u00a0\nthere that you can lean on to find those partners\u00a0\u00a0 crunchbase angellist pitchbook signalfx an easy\u00a0\nway to start with those tools is create a list\u00a0\u00a0 of businesses that are most similar thematically\u00a0\nto yours for example open source developer tools\u00a0\u00a0 or companies that serve the creator economy\u00a0\nthen find the venture firms and partners that\u00a0\u00a0 led rounds for those companies which match your\u00a0\ncurrent stage just focus on lead investors for now\u00a0\u00a0 once you have a lead the rest of the round\u00a0\nfalls into place really quickly make sure\u00a0\u00a0 though that this venture fund hasn't invested\u00a0\nin any directly competitive companies otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 you're wasting that investor and more importantly\u00a0\nyour time and if you're located outside of a major\u00a0\u00a0 tech hub you may want to consider starting with\u00a0\ngeographically focused investors in your backyard\u00a0\u00a0 now that you have a target list you need to find\u00a0\nthe best way to get in touch with those investors\u00a0\u00a0 and ask for a meeting best case by far is a warm\u00a0\nreferral from another founder that's been funded\u00a0\u00a0 by that vc ideally a founder that's made that\u00a0\nvc a lot of money before second best is another\u00a0\u00a0 investor or friend of a vc just make sure that\u00a0\nany investors who refer you aren't competitive at\u00a0\u00a0 the same stage otherwise it's going to come off\u00a0\nas a negative signal dead last is a cold email\u00a0\u00a0 i hate to say it but most vcs get bombarded\u00a0\nby inbound and they don't usually respond to\u00a0\u00a0 them so find mutual connections on linkedin to\u00a0\nget those warm referrals and remember quality\u00a0\u00a0 over quantity a strong referral is probably\u00a0\n10 times more likely to result in a meeting\u00a0\u00a0 than a weak one make referrals easy create a short\u00a0\none to two paragraph elevator pitch with a link to\u00a0\u00a0 your deck in an email that your contacts can use\u00a0\nas a starting point in reaching out to investors\u00a0\u00a0 once you've exhausted your connections keep\u00a0\nbuilding your network at other startup events\u00a0\u00a0 and ask other founders what vcs they recommend\u00a0\nthat invest at your stage in your sector if you\u00a0\u00a0 do any cold outreach make sure it's heavily\u00a0\npersonalized so you can cut through the noise\u00a0\u00a0 now after you've sent those emails investors\u00a0\nwho are interested are going to ask for a\u00a0\u00a0 first meeting from there if all goes well you'll\u00a0\nhave more follow-up meetings often escalated to\u00a0\u00a0 the right partner who can be your deal sponsor\u00a0\ninternally at that venture fund before a final\u00a0\u00a0 meeting with the firm's entire partnership which\u00a0\nis the last step before getting a term sheet\u00a0\u00a0 your probability of getting funded increases\u00a0\nexponentially with each gate that you pass\u00a0\u00a0 it's not unusual to meet 50 or even 100 investors\u00a0\nas part of a fundraise so you need to keep track\u00a0\u00a0 of them in some form of a crm could be google\u00a0\nnotion airtable whatever you prefer i'll link\u00a0\u00a0 a few templates in the description keep track\u00a0\nof where each venture fund is in their process\u00a0\u00a0 next steps and any key questions that they've\u00a0\nraised to you try to batch investor meetings\u00a0\u00a0 in groups of 10. i found that's about the max\u00a0\nthat most founders can comfortably handle at any\u00a0\u00a0 one time and as venture firms pass don't take it\u00a0\npersonally ask them for feedback and incorporate\u00a0\u00a0 those learnings into your pitch and reach out to\u00a0\nthe next set of investors quick tip in the first\u00a0\u00a0 batch try to practice your pitch on safetynet\u00a0\ninvestors who aren't necessarily your first choice\u00a0\u00a0 and friendly vcs you know well enough to give you\u00a0\nhonest feedback and if things are going well and\u00a0\u00a0 you're getting follow-up meetings then start\u00a0\ngraduating yourself to your dream investors\u00a0\u00a0 at the top of your list and keep in mind that you\u00a0\nwant to get to decision maker as soon as you can\u00a0\u00a0 you can talk to junior investors\u00a0\nlike associates vps and principals\u00a0\u00a0 just know that if they don't escalate\u00a0\nyou to a decision maker really quickly\u00a0\u00a0 it's likely a dead end and just like any sales\u00a0\nprocess always be closing make sure you leave\u00a0\u00a0 every meeting with clear next steps and follow up\u00a0\naggressively your goal is to actually get to a yes\u00a0\u00a0 or no as soon as you can so you can move on\u00a0\nworst case is you spend time with a vc that\u00a0\u00a0 hangs around the hoop and wastes your time if\u00a0\nyou followed up with a vc multiple times and\u00a0\u00a0 you haven't heard from them in a week cross that\u00a0\nlead out and move on the single toughest part of\u00a0\u00a0 fundraising can often be just managing your own\u00a0\npsychology vcs only fun a handful of thousands of\u00a0\u00a0 companies they meet with each year parker conrad\u00a0\nfounder of billion-dollar companies benefits\u00a0\u00a0 has publicly said he pitched 60 vcs for his first\u00a0\nbusiness and got exactly zero offers there are so\u00a0\u00a0 many unheard stories like that buried in silicon\u00a0\nvalley lore even a good fundraiser is likely to\u00a0\u00a0 start off with a number of no's i found it helpful\u00a0\nto frame fundraising as an opportunity to get a\u00a0\u00a0 free sounding board for your ideas from people\u00a0\nwho've seen thousands of them if your objective\u00a0\u00a0 is to learn rather than just get money from that\u00a0\nperson sitting across the table that can make\u00a0\u00a0 these meetings less adversarial and stressful and\u00a0\nyou might actually learn something along the way\u00a0\u00a0 once you get your first offer or\u00a0\nyou're expecting your first term sheet\u00a0\u00a0 you gotta kick into gear and try to catch\u00a0\nthe rest of the vcs in your pipeline\u00a0\u00a0 up to the finish line your goal is to create\u00a0\na competitive bidding process for your round\u00a0\u00a0 that gives you the best chance to have the\u00a0\nleverage to diligence and pick your ideal partner\u00a0\u00a0 and get the best terms you're looking for don't\u00a0\nmake the mistake of setting a price yourself\u00a0\u00a0 say you're letting the market price your\u00a0\ncompany and let each investor propose the terms\u00a0\u00a0 and then you can begin negotiating from there be\u00a0\ncareful of over-optimizing for valuation though\u00a0\u00a0 it's a natural thing to focus on because it's\u00a0\na measure of how much your company is worth\u00a0\u00a0 but there's actually other terms like liquidity\u00a0\npreference and veto rights that could be even more\u00a0\u00a0 impactful for your business one day i'll be making\u00a0\na separate video for understanding deal terms like\u00a0\u00a0 convertible notes saves and equity rounds which i\u00a0\nknow can be really confusing it's also important\u00a0\u00a0 to note that often the highest valuation is often\u00a0\noffered by the least valuable vcs who have to win\u00a0\u00a0 by paying more so do your homework on vcs that\u00a0\ngive you an offer do references from founders\u00a0\u00a0 they've backed before and spend time getting to\u00a0\nknow them date them before you get married because\u00a0\u00a0 the investor found a relationship doesn't have a\u00a0\nnow clause there's no divorces so you better be\u00a0\u00a0 willing to have this person on your cap table for\u00a0\nthe next decade through good times and bad after\u00a0\u00a0 you choose a vc and sign a term sheet make sure\u00a0\nyou don't fumble the ball at the one yard line and\u00a0\u00a0 push it to successful close once you finally get\u00a0\nthat wire and see the money in your bank account\u00a0\u00a0 then you can celebrate an important milestone\u00a0\ncongratulations you're one of

        "Transcript": "(narrator)\nThe greatest mysteries of humanity. Inexplicable events, places shrouded\nin legend, and superhuman heroes. People don\u2019t want to believe\nin a world without miracles, because this means a world without soul. They are the mysterious legacy\nof ancient cultures. Myths come from an oral tradition.\nEach retelling is different. The heroic become more heroic\nand the power becomes more powerful. Researchers worldwide are working\nto get to the bottom of these myths. (Willis) So advanced is modern historical research\nand archaeology, we just need to keep looking. One culture that has provided\nample material for myths is the old Egyptian civilization. Powerful pharaohs ruled\nthe country for over 3,000 years, worshipped as gods\nby their loyal subjects. One such pharaoh\nis particularly mysterious: Tutankhamun,\nthe King with the golden mask. The Valley of the Kings, 1922. Archaeologist Howard Carter\nconducts large excavation works. He\u2018s looking for treasures:\ngold, grave offerings, and mummies. After years of searching,\nhe finally gets lucky. One of his workers comes across\na secret cavity with a stairway. Right away, Carter sends a telegram\nto his sponsor Lord Carnavon: \"At last have made wonderful discovery\nin Valley. Stop. A magnificent tomb\nwith seals intact. Stop. Re-covered same for your arrival. Stop. Carter.\" Two weeks later, Lord Carnavon\ntravels to the Valley of the Kings. It will be his last journey. Carnarvon and Carter are looking at one\nof the greatest archaeological finds ever. But soon,\ninexplicable events start to unfold. With every piece they take out\nof the pharaoh\u2019s vault, the Golden King's anger\nappears to increase. The first casualty shakes\nthe excavation team. Lord Carnarvon, the financier, dies. The world press reports\nthe second sensation within a short time. First, the discovery of the tomb\nand now the deadly curse of the pharaoh. The curse gave the press a juicy story. It led to mystery, which excited not just the journalists, but their audiences. If you want a story to be\nwell-known, make it a secret. 17 people die,\nallegedly from the curse of the pharaoh. Among the dead is Arthur Mace,\nCarter\u2019s right hand. Is the tomb really the cause\nof all these deaths? Does the ancient corpse have sinister\npowers that haunt us in the present? (in Arabic) (dubbed in English)\nThe tomb discovery unleashed the curse. The facts surrounding\nthe tomb are obscure. The young king\nwas very mysterious. He took the throne when he was eight\nor nine years old and died at 18 or 19. Tutankhamun was the son of Akhenaten,\na revolutionary pharaoh. He and his spouse, Nefertiti,\nwere to be treated like gods. After Akhenaten\u2019s death, he was succeeded\nby his young son, Tutankhamun. Ten years later, he is also dead. Tutankhamun completely disappeared\nfrom the history books after his death. So without finding his tomb, we'd probably still not know\nabout this pharaoh. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Valuable artifacts from\nTutankhamun's tomb are on display here. Some are particularly impressive, like these large wooden shrines\nthat Carter found in the vault. (in Arabic) (dubbed in English) The shrine was located\nwithin the three other shrines. Inside, they found four sarcophagi,\nplaced one inside the other. Just like the Russian Matryoshka dolls,\nwhere the dolls are inside each other. Four large rooms, one built into the next,\nhome to those four sarcophagi. The last one contained the four coffins. And was in the shrine back there. I'll show you. This shrine was inside this one. Which was inside that one. And this last shrine is the largest. It contained all the others. Carter has to take apart the shrines\ninside the small tomb. They were just too large. All tightly placed into one another,\nbarely an inch apart. Carter needs to build special tools not to destroy\nthe wooden coffins or the intarsia. Finally, it emerges:\nthe golden mask and the mummy. But because resin was used to embalm\nthe mummy, the mask stuck to the body. Carter finally just rips\nthe golden mask off Tutankhamun\u2019s face. The Zurich Institute\nof Evolutionary Medicine. Professor R\u00fchli has examined\nTutankhamun\u2019s corpse several times. (in German) (dubbed in English) Carter cut off its\nentire head, damaging it in the process. Carter disassembled\nthe mummy into individual parts. He thought this was\nthe best way to display the treasures. (dubbed in English) Some of the parts\nhave been put back together, so the damage\nis only visible to a certain extent. They wanted to make it look\nlike they left the body more or less intact\nfor future generations. Time and again, scientists have tried\nto examine the pharaoh. Why did he die so young? Based on their research, experts agree\nTutankhamun died at around 19. There were no signs he was murdered. So why did he die? (R\u00fchli) There are theories that he was\nrun over by a chariot and was injured. Based on current findings, I believe most of these injuries\nare the result of handling that took place in the 1920s. But we are unable to prove that. State-of-the-art methods\nand DNA analysis reveal sobering facts about the young king... who history had almost forgotten about. The beautiful golden mask hides\na deformed face, marked by disease. Tutankhamun\u2019s body shows\nclear signs of incest. The young pharaoh was probably ill\nfrom birth. He had a club foot. This would explain why archaeologists\nfound some 130 walking canes in his tomb. In addition,\nhe had an acute malaria infection. This mixture of disease, genetic defects, and a potential accident\nmay have led to his premature death. (Machin) His story is fascinating, partly because he was such a young king\nwho died at a very young age, but also because we are\nfascinated by Egyptian life, by this civilization that existed\nthousands of years ago and has practically\ndisappeared into the dust. We love to hear these magical stories\nof kings and their adventures. Add a curse and you have an amazing story\nto hand down the generations. But what about\nthe mysterious deaths? In fact, the discoverers\nof the burial chamber died much less spectacularly\nthan long thought. The majority died of natural causes. The curse of the pharaoh: no magic power,\nbut rather a successful PR stunt. Humans have always sought explanations\nfor catastrophes and great misfortune and they often find them in myths. Some of the oldest myths of humanity were\nwritten down to teach people a lesson. In the fourth century BC,\nGreek philosopher Plato describes Atlantis as a splendid island nation\nwhose residents were doomed. Was there actually such a civilization\nthat was completely wiped out? What is the myth of the lost island\nkingdom really trying to tell us? Atlantis, the magnificent island nation. It is said\nto have consisted of several rings. At its heart, Poseidon\u2019s temple. It was home\nto the most advanced culture of its time. But the Atlanteans were also arrogant,\nso the gods decided to punish them. Atlantis was completely annihilated\nin a dramatic catastrophe. The myth of Atlantis is important to us,\nbecause it's the story of a once highly-developed culture,\nwhich has utterly disappeared. It's a story of hubris. It's a story of punishment. In the modern world\nin which we think we know so much, it serves as a pretty powerful warning. We can read\nabout the legend in Plato\u2019s work. In 360 BC, he describes Atlantis\nas a splendid island nation, which had ruled over\nthe entire Mediterranean region 9,000 years earlier,\nwith untold wealth and unparalleled power. The story\nabout the end of this civilization has enthralled generations worldwide. To this day, many people\nnot only look for the location, but also the superhuman power\nthat Atlantis is said to emit. SS Chief Heinrich Himmler\nspent large sums trying to prove that the Teutons\ndescended from the Atlanteans. He hoped archaeologists would find\nevidence of ancient Aryans in Atlantis. Their search took them as far as Tibet,\nbut they left empty-handed. The search for Atlantis is also fueled\nby the discovery of another city. Troy was long thought to be a myth described in The Iliad\nby the Greek poet, Homer. In 1870, Heinrich Schliemann finds\nthe ancient city in today\u2019s Turkey. Can Atlantis be found, too? We have so many stories about Atlantis.\nIt is a magical undersea world. If you were the archaeologist\nto discover that, you would go down in history. But is there any truth to the myth? Did Atlantis really exist? If it did, are there any traces? Greece. The island of Santorini. This\nmight have been the location of Atlantis. Its ring-like structure\nis the result of volcanic activity that has shaped the local landscape\nfor thousands of years. Geologist Evi Nomikou is familiar\nwith the stories about Atlantis. The island attracts myths like a magnet. Before 3,600 years at this place, there was a small island\nwith the same geometry, with the same composition,\nlava composition. And at the top of this volcano,\na city was built on. Santorini is located\non an ancient volcano. When it erupted thousands\nof years ago, it wreaked havoc. The crater became clogged\nwith boulders and eventually exploded. A natural catastrophe,\njust like Plato describes. Scientists look for evidence\nin the sea surrounding the crater. Using modern technology, they\u2019re examining\nthe volcanic rocks underwater. This is a small robot. This is a small ROV. We call it Jason. And we will explore the sea floor very close to Nea Kameni\njust to see the morphology of the lava that is cooling down on the sea floor. Eight engines and three cameras. The robot replaces the divers\nand provides high-resolution images. It passes by lava\nsolidified a long time ago. Just like the islands, the volcanic eruption\nshaped the seafloor around it. And at last, a discovery. Underwater stairs. Could they belong to a former harbor? An entrance to the city of Atlantis? Evi Nomikou is one step closer\nto finding Atlantis. But she will need to conduct more dives to find out whether these steps\nare manmade or a product of nature. I believe there was a magic city in the middle of the caldera. And that city has been\ndestroyed completely. But we need to search more\nand explore more. And when we find\nsome evidence from the seafloor, not something that we will find on land, then I will be completely sure\nSantorini was Atlantis. But something doesn\u2019t add up\nin the Santorini theory. According to Plato, Atlantis is located\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, behind Gibraltar. US researcher Richard Freund is convinced he\u2019ll be able to unearth\nAtlantis in this region. Following Plato\u2019s descriptions,\nhe\u2019s got his eyes set on southern Spain. His search takes him\nto the Do\u00f1ana National Park. He believes today\u2019s dunes\ncover the once important harbor and the ring-shaped islands. He suspects the coast line\nhas shifted over the centuries. We are at Ground Zero for Atlantis Freund visits a 1920's excavation site. The dig was never finished. Today, the park is protected. It is impossible\nto conduct new excavations. A rock formation is sticking out\nof the ground, maybe a wall. We're gonna measure this this edge.\nAnd then I wanna measure this edge. This is a right angle. There are no\nright angles in nature. This is manmade. If his theory is correct, this wall might have once belonged\nto the powerful city of Atlantis. There should be no major stone\nlike that in this area... and yet it's there. But so far, there\u2019s no evidence\ncorroborating Freund\u2019s theories. Maybe Atlantis will be discovered one day. Until then, it remains\nthe great myth of a lost civilization. Myths often go hand in hand with faith. The greatest legends therefore\noften have a religious motivation. Like the famous Grail relic, that is inextricably linked to Jesus and\nthe idea of redemption and eternal life. Did the Holy Grail really exist? The eve of the crucifixion. The Bible says Jesus handed his disciples a cup of wine, saying \u201cThis is my blood.\u201d He promises\nto remain present in bread and wine. Those who drink from the cup\nare part of this community, and can hope for a life after death. The Holy Grail is like a condensed conduit\nfor the power of creation, which can be used to heal,\nto restore sanity. It comes in the form of a cornucopia,\nwhich delivers the sustenance of life in the womb from which life comes. You name it, the Grail, in its essence,\nrepresents the source of creation itself. The chalice is lost for centuries. In medieval times, however,\nthe crusaders revive the legend. They want to conquer the Holy Land\nand bring all the relics back to Europe. Vessels that prompt speculation\nsurface time and time again. Which goblet is the real Holy Grail? Bowls made of wood, or of precious stone? The Nazis are looking\nfor the Grail as well. Himmler, head of the SS,\nis obsessed with occult Germanic rites. The mass murderer firmly believes\nhe who has the Grail will be invincible. But his search comes up short. All sorts of people\nhave hunted for the Grail, because it's such\na mysterious object. If you were the one\nwho could find it, after centuries of being lost,\nthen you prove you've got the power, the legitimacy,\nyou were destined to own it. That's exactly why Hitler and Himmler\nsearched for the Grail during WWII. It would prove they had a right\nto be doing what they were doing. Valencia Cathedral has been the home\nof the Santo C\u00e1liz for centuries. Believers think it is the cup\nJesus Christ held in his hands. But is this the true Holy Grail? Many details support the theory\nthat the richly ornamented chalice could be the Grail. Examinations have shown it was made\nabout 2,000 years ago in the Middle East. But is that enough\nto prove its authenticity? According to one widespread hypothesis, the cup came to Rome\nat some point during the first century. There, an early and persecuted\nChristian community might have hidden it, maybe in the catacombs\nbeneath the metropolis. And indeed, the catacombs of Rome show\na cup resembling the Valencian chalice. The first popes used this cup to celebrate\nHoly Mass in the underground. It\u2019s the era of Christian persecution. However, the subsequent path\nof the chalice remains unclear... until an ancient Latin text offers a clue. It says Jesus used\n\"hunc praecl\u00e1rum C\u00e1licem,\" this precious chalice. They probably meant the Santo C\u00e1liz. For 20 years, Michael Hesemann\nhas been looking for evidence. His key to the Grail: the medieval verse romance Parzival\nwritten by Wolfram von Eschenbach. The protagonist allegedly saw\nthe Grail with his own eyes. (in German) (dubbed in English) Parzival is a treasure\nmap. Follow it and you'll find the Grail. Hesemann stumbles across\na suspicious location in the text. The castle where the Grail is kept\nis referred to as Montsalvatge. Michael Hesemann sets out to find\nthis legendary castle in Spain. His quest for the Grail\ntakes him to the Spanish Pyrenees. In his theory, the Grail was taken from\nJerusalem to Rome after Jesus\u2019 death, and later brought to Spain\nby St. Lawrence, a third century deacon. (in German) (dubbed in English)\nThis is Mont Salvatoris, the Pico de Sant Salvador. In the local Occitan language\nspoken in Aragon at the time, it was called Montsalvatge. And later, this became the name\nof the Castle of the Grail in Parzival. The text comes with directions: \"At the foot of that mountain turn right.\" At the end of the path lies\nan ancient building hidden under a ledge, the monastery of San Juan de la Pe\u00f1a. If the Grail had been here,\nthere could still be traces of it today. Michael Hesemann wants to take\na closer look at the monastic maze. The heroic epic provides\nan exact account of the rooms where Perceval sees the Grail. (in German) (dubbed in English)\nIn the middle, he saw four pillars, and in between a giant fire was ablaze. We can see one, two, three,\nfour large pillars here, and one, two, three spaces in between\nwhere the braziers were placed. There is evidence\nMichael Hesemann is right and that there was a cup that was\nworshipped here in the Middle Ages. Is it the one in Valencia today? Spain isn\u2019t the only place\nwhere legends about the Grail circulate. Many believe the Grail was hidden\nin Glastonbury in south-west England, in the first century. After Jesus died,\nan old legend of the Grail suggests Joseph of Arimathea collected his blood\nin a cup and brought it to England. He\u2019s said to have\nhidden it in Glastonbury, where one of the most influential\nmonasteries of the Middle Ages was erected, Glastonbury Abbey. A painting in the Abbey chapel tells how Joseph of Arimathea\ntravelled to England with the Grail. It has never been found. There is a legend around King Arthur, who is said to have been buried\non an island called Avalon. Some believe\nAvalon and Glastonbury are the same place. The legends of Arthur and his Round Table\nare inextricably linked to the Holy Grail. Finding it is the top mission\nof the noble order of knights. The myth of Arthur\nbeing linked with the Holy Grail is a very important part\nof the Arthur story. It makes him more powerful. It gives him the divine anointment\nhe needs to make him into a true legend\nwhich can withstand the years. The only thing that we can be\nsure of regarding the Holy Grail is that knowing and believing\naren\u2019t the same things. Where things lie hidden,\nthere\u2019s a myth waiting to be discovered. Treasure hunters don\u2019t only set their eyes\non objects with religious meaning, but also on places\nsaid to hold great riches. The Song of the Nibelungs\nis probably the most famous German saga. It tells the story of the legendary\ntreasure of Siegfried, the dragon slayer. But where is his gold now? The Rhine. Center stage\nfor the tale of the Nibelungs, dating back to the late antiquity\nand the migration period. It\u2019s a saga of greed, treason, and murder, and a huge treasure,\nstolen by Siegfried, the dragon slayer. Legend has it that the Rhine\nwas once home to the Burgundian kingdom. There Siegfried marries Kriemhild,\nthe sister of King Gunther. The King\u2019s adviser, Hagen von Tronje,\nis obsessed with Siegfried\u2019s treasure: 40 cartloads of gold and silver,\nand an invisibility cloak. Hagen turns\nKing Gunther against Siegfried. At the king\u2019s behest, he kills the hero\nand hides the gold in the Rhine. The river has kept the secret ever since. The Hagen monument in Worms\nis a reminder of the Nibelungs. But without the treasure\nand the hope to find it, this tale would have\nlikely been forgotten long ago. We're fascinated by treasure,\npartly because of the monetary value, but the treasures that we see\nin myth tend to be more than that. They have a magical value to them,\na personality of themselves they're a character in the story. Think in the Nibelungen\nof Siegfried's invisibility cloak. We like the idea of there\nbeing something in the world that connects us\nto a realm beyond our own. It's a magical power. But how much historical truth\nis hidden in the ancient writings? St. Gall, Switzerland. There\u2019s an important clue here. The Benedictine monastery houses\none of the oldest manuscripts of the Song of the Nibelungs. It dates back to the second half\nof the 13th century. Joachim Heinzle knows\nthe Nibelungs saga better than most. He believes the text is based\non true events that took place many centuries\nbefore the manuscript was written. (in German) (dubbed in English) Heroic legends\nwere considered historical, a form of passing on history. According to the saga,\nSiegfried\u2019s widow Kriemhild seeks revenge after the death of her husband. She turns away from the Burgundians\nand marries Etzel, king of the Huns. Upon her invitation,\nKing Gunther and his entire entourage travel to the court of the Hun king. They all die in an unparalleled bloodbath. The Burgundians really existed. At the start of the migration, the Burgundians set up\nsettlements along the Rhine. And the heart of their Empire is exactly\nwhere the Nibelungen saga is set: Worms. And just as in the saga,\nthe real Burgundians are doomed. In around 435, they are defeated\nby Roman and Hun troops. (battle cries) (horse whinnies) King Gunther\u2019s character is based\non the real Burgundian King Gundahar. And King Etzel\nhas a real counterpart, too: Attila, legendary leader of the Huns. Like Etzel, Attila is said to have\nbeen married to a Germanic woman. The Nibelungenlied\nmixes reality with fiction. There were people called the Burgundians. This is a story\nabout the fall of those great people. We also have the Hun, who are mythologized as being scary. The fact that it\nhas this central core of reality means we can actually\nbelieve all aspects of the myth, which makes it more powerful. If the protagonists\nof the saga really existed, then the Nibelung treasure\ncould also be real. But where is it hidden? The Nibelung treasure\ncan definitely exist. Between the third and the sixth centuries,\npeople buried things constantly, particularly precious metals gold,\nsilver, jewelry, dishes, weapons. And indeed, silent witnesses of the era\noccasionally emerge from the Rhine. The last sensational find\ndates back to 1967, when dredgers came across\nan incredible treasure in a gravel pit. Heino Neumayer,\ncurator of the Neues Museum Berlin, safeguards the treasure,\nknown as the hoard of Neupotz. (German dubbed in English)\nIt's extraordinary, unique. It\u2019s the biggest hoard from Roman times\nthat was ever found north of the Alps. Richly adorned weapons and vessels.\nSilver, bronze, copper. The value of the raw materials\nalone is quite impressive. A huge treasure like the one\nin the Nibelungenlied. The coin finds date it\nrelatively clearly to the year 259, 250 years before the events\nin the Nibelung saga. It\u2019s not Siegfried\u2019s gold,\nbut a silver lining nevertheless. The real treasure may still be\nout there, waiting to be found. The possibilities are unlimited, because the course of the river\nhas changed over centuries. What used to be the bottom\nof the Rhine is dry land today. Amateur researchers scour the woods\nalong the Rhine with metal detectors. Sometimes with great success. In 2014, Benjamin Czerny\nfinds gold and silver jewelry worth more than a million euros. The find of his life. (in German) (dubbed in English) We felt an adrenaline\nrush as we found the individual parts and saw how they shimmered,\nall silver and golden. The best outcome for any treasure hunter. He films the entire hoard at his home\nand proudly presents his discovery online. (Czerny) The most beautiful piece. Unfortunately, the gems are missing,\nthey probably fell out. The video attracts the attention of the\nauthorities, who then seize the treasure. It ends up in the State Museum of Coblenz. Experts determine\nthat the gold came from the Huns. It\u2019s not the Nibelung treasure, but it's proof the Huns\nwere near the Rhine at the same time as the Burgundians. Another find that keeps\nthe Nibelung treasure myth alive, and raises hopes that the Rhine\nis yet to reveal its greatest secret. Myths often revolve\naround real historical figures. After all, human history\nhas produced legendary rulers, like Attila, the king of the Huns. Feared during his lifetime,\nhe became a myth after his death. Where is the great leader buried? It\u2019s the year 453. Although Attila has already suffered\nhis first military defeats, he is still the powerful ruler\nof an impressive empire. His marriage to Ildico,\na Germanic princess, is supposed\nto further stabilize Attila\u2019s power. But the honeymoon phase doesn\u2019t last long. Attila dies the night they were married. Was it an accident? Or murder? Today, it seems likely that the king died\nas a result of his excessive drinking. The greatest unsolved mystery:\nWhere is his tomb? His dead body is said to be protected\nby three layers of iron, silver, and gold. Allegedly, Attila\u2019s followers\ncut off their hair and scratched their faces to mourn\nhis death with blood instead of tears. But where could he be buried? It\u2019s like looking\nfor a needle in a haystack. The Huns were on the move\nin almost all of Europe. In the West, they enter the stage\nof history in the 5th century AD. In bloody battles, the warrior horsemen\nadvance into the heart of Europe. Their greatest enemies, the Romans. We don't know exactly\nwhy the Huns started to move. Perhaps it was climate change\nor the search for new fertile land for their growing number of horsemen. We are certain, when they started to move, they pushed in front of them\ntens of thousands of people and they fought those tribes, pushing them up against the walls\nof the Roman Empire. Attila was probably\nthe most successful Hun leader. He knew how to unite the feuding tribes. Today, we don\u2019t even know\nwhat he looked like, because there are no written documents. The Huns were an illiterate people. The only reports about them\ncome from their enemies. The former Hun empire\nis mainly located in today\u2019s Hungary. Remains of the warriors on horseback\nare scattered all across the country. To really understand the Huns,\nscientists study their dead. Archaeologist G\u00e1bor Wilhelm\nspecializes in excavating antique tombs. Only recently, Wilhelm\u2019s team discovered\na particularly spectacular object. It is the skull of a warrior,\nwho lived at the same period as Attila. He was buried in a Hun ritual. (in Hungarian) (dubbed in English)\nThis tomb is an important find, because there are still\nmany unanswered questions on the Huns. Thanks to written tradition,\nwe know a few things about Attila, but finds from this era are rare. Even the smallest artefacts help us\nto complete this mosaic, this puzzle. But who is this mysterious Hun warrior? The tomb is unusually exquisite. Golden jewelry,\nbelt buckles, an iron sword. No doubt this has to be\nthe grave of a powerful man. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not Attila. The warrior died young. Attila, however, probably\nlived until the age of 50. Experts believe Attila was\nburied with precious treasures: gold, silver, and invaluable riches\nfor those who find his tomb. He is said to have been buried\nunder a river in a secret ceremony. Riverbeds are wonderful locations\nfor preserving historic material. There is no air and that means the\nmaterial can be preserved for centuries. There's a chance\nif we found the right place, Attila\u2019s burial chamber\nwould be preserved just perfectly. But how could a king\nbe buried under a river? With islands to shorten the dam. A natural barrier would mean the water\nonly needs to be dammed on one side, while the other side\nserves as a natural drain. Later, a wall\ncan be built on that side, too. This way, Attila\u2019s men\nmight have been able to dig a grave that could be flooded afterwards. The Danube has changed\nits course over centuries. Where are you supposed to start looking? We found Roman materials\nand far older relics along the Danube. I don't see why we wouldn't\nfind memories of the Huns, or even Attila's grave. Not all researchers believe\nin the underwater theory. They\u2019re looking somewhere else. Budapest. This is where the life\u2019s work\nof an unknown author is stored. The Hungarians refer\nto him as \u201cAnonymous.\u201d His work is titled the Gesta Hungarorum,\n\"The Deeds of the Hungarians.\" The 800-year-old manuscript\nmentions the \"city of King Attila.\" But where is this ancient royal city? Some think it could be\nthe medieval town of Sicambria. Sicambria is believed to be lost. But its ruins might be found\nin the woods of the Pilis Mountains. Ecologist Imre L\u00e1nszki\nhas followed the Gesta Hungarorum and is convinced he\u2019s found the remains\nof the ancient city in this forest. (dubbed in English)\nThis is the wall of Attila\u2019s castle. The wall was already here back then. If he is right,\nAttila\u2019s tomb might also be hidden somewhere among these trees and rocks. L\u00e1nszki starts drilling into the ground. He hopes to find a cavity\nhiding the tomb of Attila. An endoscope camera probe\nslowly makes its way through the soil. (L\u00e1nszki) This is a fragmented stone. And the rock is not the same. But whether Attila was really buried\nin this forest remains unclear. The same goes for the question\nas to who Attila really was: a cruel barbarian\nor a skillful negotiator? The only way to find out\nis to discover his tomb. But great myths are more\nthan just windows into the past. Some ancient myths\nhave stood the test of time and are echoed\nin urban legends to this day. The infamous werewolves have become\nan integral part of today\u2019s pop culture. They are the epitome of evil. We have an innate fear of horrible beasts and we crave danger\njust as much as we are scared of it. 18th-century France. An eerie creature wanders the woods\nof G\u00e9vaudan in the south of the country. (she screams) It is soon dubbed the Beast of G\u00e9vaudan. It targets women and children.\nThe victims have one thing in common. They have claw marks. Bernard Soulier is a writer\nand an expert in local history. He knows everything\nabout the documents describing the beast. (French dubbed in English)\nThe beast often attacked people here, like the time they found\na 16-year-old girl here in 1765. Her name was Agn\u00e8s Morgues. The beast decapitated her. They found her dead body and her head, which had been severed\nfrom the rest of the body. Those beheadings are what\nthe experts find most disturbing. I think there\u2019s a resemblance\nbetween this animal and a wolf, but there\u2019s one major difference\nand that\u2019s its aggressive behavior. The beast is said to have killed at least\n78 people, and beheaded 16 of them. Some of the victims were naked. People start panicking.\nCould the attacker be a werewolf? A creature half man, half wolf? Werewolves, they are\nthe embodiment of evil. Their transformation begins at full moon. Fur grows all over the body,\nmuscles grow beyond human proportions, finger nails turn into sharp claws,\nhands become paws. (snarling) The werewolf has the upright posture\nand intelligence of a human, but attacks its victims\nwith the force of a predator. The werewolf is an ideal figure of horror: It reminds us of our animalistic side and the fact we are\nonly a few steps from reverting to it. Also they are the embodiment of evil. The way we picture werewolves today has primarily been influenced\nby horror movies. But the descriptions\nof shapeshifters are much older. In about 700 BC, Greek poet Hesiod\nmentions a man-wolf for the first time. Zeus is said to have punished King Lycaon\nby turning his head into that of a wolf. The Roman author Titus Petronius\nthen adds the full moon as a trigger. Nordic legends like Egil\u2019s Saga\nalso feature werewolves. The Germanic word \u201cwer,\u201d signifying \u201cman,\u201d gives them their name \u201cwerewolves.\u201d By the early modern period, the concept\nof werewolves is already widespread. The Church also chases so-called\nwerewolves during the witch-hunts. The witch-hunt is based on a book. Malleus Maleficarum, \"Hammer of Witches\" by Dominican monk Heinrich Kramer. He declares that witches, magicians,\nand werewolves live right among us. The Church adopted stories of werewolves to try and keep people in line. So as a man, if you misbehaved, if you made a pact with the devil,\nthen you could become a werewolf. And this was the ultimate sanction\nto make sure that people stayed in line. The probably most well-known\nalleged werewolf comes from Bedburg, close to the German city of Cologne. The man is said to have\nhaunted the region in 1589. Historian Utz Anhalt knows\nthe details of the case inside out. (in German) (dubbed in English) Peter Stubbe,\nthe most famous werewolf of all, is said to have committed\nhis crimes in this forest. He confessed to killing 16 people,\nmainly children, and to eating them, hungry for their flesh. He also admitted to having\nkilled and eaten livestock, and to committing incest\nwith his own daughter. Back in his day, Peter Stubbe\nwas seen as the personification of evil. Keeping a low profile, he lives discreetly\namong his alleged victims for a long time. A vigilante group chases\na dangerous wolf terrorizing the region. Before the beast manages to escape, one of the farmers\ncuts off one of its paws. Afterwards, Stubbe is said\nto have been missing one of his hands like the animal that lost its paw. He is arrested and confesses\nto all his crimes under torture. He admits receiving a belt from the devil,\nallowing him to transform into a wolf. His fate is sealed. A court sentences him to death. A leaflet from London from 1590\ntells Stubbe\u2019s story like a graphic novel. (Anhalt) They broke his arms and legs,\nso they could wind them into the spokes. They went on and tore pieces of flesh\nout of his body with red-hot pliers. They beheaded his mutilated body, and in the end,\nthe entire body was burned. In ancient myths, the lines between\ndark forces and mythical creatures, fantastic tales\nand crimes of cruelty often blur. Is it possible that a human being\nwas behind the killings in G\u00e9vaudan? The mysterious beast is eventually\ndefeated by one of the locals. His name, Jean Chastel. One single shot and it\u2019s done. The bullet pierces the animal\u2019s heart. The murders stop...\nbut the story has a dubious hero. It\u2019s the miraculous shot\nthat raises doubts. Chastel was about 20 meters away\nfrom a moving target, and killed the animal with a single shot. A level of precision nearly impossible\nto achieve with a 18th-century weapon. Unless the beast didn\u2019t move. Maybe because it recognized the hunter. Bernard Soulier has his own theory. (in French) (dubbed in English) Wolf hunters of\nthe 18th century would catch young wolves and cross-breed them with hounds. They wanted to breed animals\nfor greater endurance, more resilience, more strength. Such a hybrid might not fear people,\nand could even readily attack them. The murders might really\nhave been committed by a creature, half man, half animal, a hound and its owner. The greatest myths also emerge in places\nwhere inexplicable phenomena cause fear in people. Bizarre lights in the sky, ships\nand airplanes disappearing without trace. Natural events like these\nare what stories are made of. People have always found\nthe extreme weather and ruthless sea in the Bermuda Triangle terrifying. But what\u2019s behind\nthe secrets of the devil\u2019s triangle? December 5th, 1945, around noon, five US torpedo bombers\ntake off from their base in Florida. It\u2019s a routine training flight. Targeted bombing\nand navigating above open water. Halfway there, the squadron leader\nreports compass problems. The pilots are disoriented. Then radio contact breaks off. To this day, all 14 crew members\nand their aircrafts are missing. Flight 19 became so famous,\nbecause it wasn't just one plane, it wasn't just one ship,\nit was five planes. It was an entire squadron\nand they were never found. When they disappear, the men are in the middle\nof the infamous Bermuda Triangle. For centuries the waters between Florida,\nPuerto Rico, and the Bermuda Islands have been shrouded in mysteries. Over the last 100 years,\nmore than 50 ships and 20 airplanes are said to have vanished here\nwithout a trace. Exact numbers are unknown. Time and again, eye witnesses report\nbizarre phenomena in the area. Charles Lindbergh,\nthe legendary transatlantic aviator, also had an unusual experience. In February 1928, he takes off\non a non-stop flight from Havana, Cuba to his home, St. Louis, Missouri. (actor as Lindbergh)\nBoth compasses malfunctioned. The liquid compass card\nrotated without stopping. Could recognize no stars\nthrough heavy haze. Liquid compass card kept rotating\nuntil the Spirit of St. Louis reached the Florida coast. So we know the compass\nspun around uncontrollably. He wasn\u2019t able to navigate by the stars. When he found out where he was,\nhe was 300 miles off course, near Bahama Island. One of the most spectacular cases is the\ndisappearance of the USS Cyclops in 1918. A gigantic US Navy vessel. In their official report,\nthe US Navy concludes, \u201cThere has been no more baffling mystery\nin the annals of the Navy than the disappearance\nof the USS Cyclops.\u201d No radio messages. No distress signals. No signs of life. How can a ship of that size\njust vanish into thin air? Part of the fame to do with the event\nwas also associated with the war. So she was lost during the war. There was fear over what the Germans\nmight be doing with their U-boats. The Cyclops was not in waters\nthat should have been fought over, but perhaps the Germans\nwere operating U-boats there. There's fear associated with the war,\nwhich made this myth so powerful. For the first time, people start talking\nabout the treacherous waters. Rumors linked German saboteurs,\nsupernatural forces, and giant sea monsters\nto its disappearance. Author Marvin Barrash has been\ninvestigating the case for years. He is familiar with the myths\nsurrounding the ship. However, he does not believe in a miracle. Rather, he is sure to have found\na clue in the documents. There is this\nUS Weather Bureau chart that indicates there is a large weather system\non the east coast of the United States that could have indeed traveled\nwith this large low system into the area\nwhere the Cyclops was on her way home. But if the Cyclops really was in distress, why didn\u2019t she call for help? I suspect a rogue wave, the type of thing\nthat would not have been anticipated. Without warning, no time to prepare. And I suspect likely at night. Monster waves develop when several swells\nof different lengths overlap. Long waves travel faster\nand can overtake shorter waves. As the wave heights combine,\nthey can reach up to 30 meters. Did the USS Cyclops fall victim\nto such a monster wave? Could the myth of the Bermuda Triangle\nhave a simple explanation, like unpredictable weather? But what about the compass anomalies\nreported by Lindbergh and others? The Bermuda Islands are\nthe remnants of an ancient volcano formed more than 30 million years ago. Witnesses of an apocalyptic moment\nin the history of the planet. Nick Hutchings is exploring\nthe underwater rocks. If we were standing at this exact spot\n33 million years ago, we would be under 3,000 feet of lava. This was a big volcanic island then. Over millions of years, the volcanic rock\nis eroded by wind and weather and washed into the sea. Today, a layer of lava sand\n150 meters thick covers the ocean floor around the islands. Hutchings believes the volcanic floor\ncould explain some of the phenomena seen in the Bermuda Triangle. Magnetite is the most magnetic\nnaturally-occurring mineral on earth. The magnetite in these minerals here\nis enough to affect a compass. Just this little bit here. And as you can see,\nas we move this compass over here... it moves. It\u2019s not a lot, three or four degrees,\nbut it's enough to cause a disaster. You can imagine what\n500 billion tons might do. According to that, Bermuda is a huge magnet\nin the middle of the ocean. A magnetic compass\nwould point in a different direction. This can cause ships\nand planes to go off course. The Bermuda Triangle\ndoesn't stand out statistically, it stands out in our imaginations. It becomes a place\nwhere we project whatever our myth is. If your myth is that everything\nis explainable, you project that. If your myth is\nthere are aliens or Atlantis that also is gonna be what you project\nonto the Bermuda Triangle. History\u2019s greatest mysteries. For millennia,\nthey have roused our curiosity... intrigued us, or served as a warning. And so they will continue\nto fascinate us in the future.",

        "Transcript": "Brainy Dose Presents: 11 Interesting Psychological Facts About Human\nBehavior Have you ever wondered why we think, feel,\nand behave in the ways that we do? It\u2019s a source of fascination for many. After all, the way our minds function has\na lot to do with how we do things and how we are. Human behavior, brain function, and mental\nprocesses have been studied extensively. And while there are still a lot of unanswered\nquestions, and there is a long way to go, by learning about the fundamentals of behavior\nand the human mind, we're able to gain a better understanding of ourselves and others. In this video, we have gathered some truly\ninteresting facts about the psychology of human behavior that will help better understand\nwhy we think, feel, and behave in certain ways. Let's jump right in! Number 1 - Things That Happen to Us in Early\nAdulthood Stay with Us Long-Term Have you ever noticed how often older people\ntalk about their early twenties? Or have you ever wondered why so many people\nlove coming of age stories? Well, this phenomenon is referred to as the\nreminiscence bump. You see, we have a preference for recalling\nexperiences from adolescence and early adulthood, primarily due to the emotional intensity of\nthis period because of the number of choices and changes that occur during that time. Graduation, marriage, the birth of a child;\nthese are all new experiences, making them much more memorable. Research also suggests that memories are easily\naccessible from the reminiscence bump because they are linked to self-identity and significantly\ncontribute to an individual's attitudes, beliefs, and life goals. Number 2 - Thinking About Your Problems from\nA Third-Person Perspective Allows You to Find Effective Solutions Would you say you think about other people's\nproblems more clearly and sensibly than your own? According to research, the answer for most\npeople is yes, and this known as the Solomon's paradox. People, regardless of age, are more likely\nto think more rationally while contemplating someone else\u2019s difficulties than when addressing\ntheir own problems. That said, a self-distancing strategy can\neliminate this bias. So, the next time you're faced with a personal\ndilemma, practice your reasoning skills by taking a step back and considering your situation\nfrom an outsider's perspective. Number 3 - Those Most Incompetent Are the\nLeast Aware of Their Own Incompetence You've probably witnessed this happen; maybe\naround the dinner table during a holiday family gathering. During the meal, an extended family member\nbegins talking about something, claiming to be right, and everyone else is foolish, ignorant,\nor just plain wrong. This person's lack of knowledge is obvious\nto everyone in the room. Yet, they continue to ramble on, blissfully\nunaware of their own ignorance. This is called the Dunning-Kruger effect,\na cognitive bias in which people think they are smarter and more capable than they actually\nare. Their poor self-awareness and low cognitive\nability leads them to overestimate their actual capabilities. Number 4 - Hostile People Tend to Own More\nAggressive Dogs Research shows that anger, aggression, and\nhostility are more common in the personality of owners of stereotypically violent breeds. Could it be possible that people choose dogs\nthat are an extension of themselves? We typically select friends and partners with\nsimilar interests and tendencies. So, why not pets? Perhaps. But other factors may also influence people's\naggression and their choice of violent breeds. For instance, those who are socially isolated,\nhave fewer visitors, or live in high-crime neighborhoods are more likely to be under\nchronic stress, possibly making them more aggressive and thus, they would be more inclined\nto pick a guard dog such as a Rottweiler or Pit Bull. Number 5 - Daydreamers Are More Creative Do you tend to get in trouble for daydreaming\nin class or during a meeting at work? Mind-wandering is often viewed as a negative\ntrait, but it's not necessarily the case. In fact, daydreaming may indicate intelligence\nand creativity! According to research, high measured intelligence\nand creativity go hand-in-hand with high levels of mind-wandering. What's more, frequent daydreamers not only\ntend to score higher on IQ tests, but their brains also appear to be more efficient. Yes, some people have more efficient brains\nthan others which translates into an increased capacity to think and, as a result, their\nbrains may wander when performing easy tasks. They can zone in and out of discussions or\ntasks when appropriate, then seamlessly tune back in without losing crucial details or\nsteps. Number 6 - Rejection Literally Hurts You Have you ever felt like you got punched in\nthe stomach after being rejected by someone? Why is that? Well, apparently, that's how our minds are\nwired to respond. Turns out, the same parts of our brains get\nactivated when we experience rejection as when we experience physical pain. That's why even small rejections hurt more\nthan they should as they elicit literal, though emotional, pain. Number 7 - Speaking in A Foreign Language\nChanges Your Decisions You might think that people would make the\nsame decisions no matter what language they were using, or that the difficulty of using\na foreign language would make decisions less systematic. However, the opposite is true. Using a foreign language is shown to reduce\ndecision-making biases. When speaking a foreign language, we need\nto suppress our native language. And, in order to think rationally, we have\nto suppress our innate intuitions. Brain imaging studies show the same parts\nof the brain are involved in both foreign-language use and rational thought. And when foreign-language speakers activate\ntheir brain's inhibition center, their intuitions and emotions are also inhibited. As a result, individuals make more rational\ndecisions when speaking a foreign language. Number 8 - We Blame a Person's Behavior On\nTheir Personality (Unless It's Us) Have you ever been infuriated by someone cutting\nyou off while driving, only to do the same thing to someone else a few minutes later? And while the person who cut you off enraged\nyou, and your reaction was along the lines of \u201cwhat a jerk\u201d or \u201cthis guy is an\na$$hole,\u201d you're likely to have justified your behavior to yourself since you were in\na hurry and you only did it once. Unfortunately, we tend to believe that others\ndo bad things because they are bad people. This is known as the fundamental attribution\nerror, the propensity to explain a person's behavior by referring to their character rather\nthan any situational context. Number 9 - We Believe That Other People Are\nMore Susceptible to Persuasion Than We Are We seem to be more aware of how advertising\naffects other people than we are of how it affects us. And this is referred to as the third person\neffect. People can see how an advertisement or a persuasive\nmessage affects their peers but not how it affects them. Further, they are more inclined to deny its\ninfluence, and it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s an ad for something they have little interest\nin. You may not realize it, but the mass media\nmessages you are subjected to regularly, subconsciously affect your mood, desires, and even attitude. Number 10 - Dopamine Makes You Addicted to\nSeeking Information Have you ever found yourself scrolling through\nyour social media feed for hours on end? It all comes down to the dopamine-seeking\nreward loop. Dopamine is known as the pleasure chemical\nbecause it causes you to seek enjoyment and pleasurable activities such as eating, sex,\ndrugs, and so on. But dopamine also makes you become curious\nand seek information! So, as you're scrolling through your feed,\nyour dopamine loop is activated, making you want to keep scrolling for more information. The troubling part is that you will never\nbe quite satisfied with the amount of information available! You'll probably keep scrolling until something\ninterrupts you. Number 11 - Regularly Helping Others Can Help\nYou Live Longer Volunteering your time, money, or energy to\nassist others is beneficial to the world, and yourself. Giving back to the community has been shown\nto boost happiness, health, and sense of well-being. Regularly volunteering can help manage stress\nand ward off sickness while also increasing your sense of fulfillment in life. This might be due to the fact that volunteering\nreduces loneliness and improves our social lives. Moreover, psychologists have found that those\nwho volunteer frequently, tend to live longer than those who don't participate in such activities. Now, even though these facts are fascinating\nand reveal a lot about human nature, keep in mind that most of them were discovered\nafter conducting research with small groups of people. Nevertheless, they do provide a fantastic\nway to raise questions and begin digging into the mysterious world of psychological research.

        "Transcript": "Although he never considered himself a philosopher,\nMarcus Aurelius\u2019 writings have become one of the most significant ancient Stoic scriptures. His \u2018Meditations\u2019 contain a series of\nnotes to himself based on Stoic ideas, one of which is embracing fate and living conformably\nto the demands of nature. Instead of wanting things to happen as we\nwish, we\u2019re better off accepting the universe, according to Marcus Aurelius, and developing\na flexible attitude towards the outside world while being strict with ourselves. Yet, most of us want our lives to be pleasant\nand expect our environment to provide us with what we need to feel content. We want friendly people around us, and we\nwant to achieve our dreams and ambitions, remain youthful, and live without misfortune. And often, we\u2019re not content with our bodies\nand inborn talents and refuse to accept our flaws. In short, there\u2019s a lot of \u2018wanting\u2019\ninvolved with being human (especially nowadays) and very little \u2018accepting\u2019 regarding\noutside circumstances. But the more we want from the universe, the\nmore we\u2019re susceptible to disappointment. In all likelihood, despite our efforts, we\u2019ll\nencounter not-so-nice people, won\u2019t achieve our dreams and ambitions (or just partially),\nwill meet with adversity, and we certainly won\u2019t escape old age. And if these unavoidable experiences distress\nus, we become playthings of our environment, emotionally dependent on its whims. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius repeatedly\nencouraged himself to embrace fate precisely the way it comes and live well regardless\nof the circumstances. This video explores why it\u2019s better to accept\nthe universe rather than oppose it and try to change it. By the way. you\u2019ll find more Stoic wisdom in this book\n- Stoicism for Inner Peace - which contains my collected works on remaining calm and focused. You\u2019ll find a link in the description. (1) Accepting other people Suppose someone throws an insulting joke at\nyour expense or at the cost of someone you love. How would a Stoic philosopher react? Would he get angry or even use physical violence\nas a response? Marcus Aurelius urged himself not to make\nmore out of an event than it is. In this case, someone made a joke at your\nexpense. But did the joke itself affect you? That\u2019s not possible. A joke can only harm you if you let it. Anger, violence, sadness: these emotions are\nof your own making and do not accompany the joke itself. Marcus Aurelius wrote about people speaking\nevil of you: \u201cAdd nothing of your own from within, and that\u2019s an end of it.\u201d End quote. Dealing with other people means dealing with\nthe unpredictable and uncontrollable. Some people are good and moral, others are\nevil and immoral, some are hardworking and helpful, and others are lazy and exploitative. Some like to make jokes; others are quick\nto use violence. Marcus Aurelius emphasized that regardless\nof people being arrogant, ungrateful, deceitful, and unsocial, we all share the nature of being\nhuman. Human nature consists of beauty and ugliness,\nso he encouraged himself to accept everyone and not be perturbed by evil people. In his mind, we\u2019re here to cooperate, not\nact against each other (which is contrary to nature). We want people to act as we wish, but reality\nteaches that people have their own will: their behavior is not up to us. We can influence them, but, ultimately, they\u2019ll\nsay what they say and do what they do, how irrational and stupid their actions may seem. And thus, spending copious amounts of energy\non trying to change others is a waste of time and better used in other areas. I quote: Don\u2019t waste the rest of your time here worrying\nabout other people\u2014unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You\u2019ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so\nis doing, and why, and what they\u2019re saying, and what they\u2019re thinking, and what they\u2019re\nup to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your\nown mind. End quote. (2) Accepting transience The great thinkers of the past, empires, and\nkingdoms: all turn to dust and ashes. Marcus Aurelius compares children to leaves\nin the wind, which grow in spring but are then blown away, and the forest then replaces\nthem with new ones. The Stoic emperor was immensely aware of how\ntemporary things are and how quickly things we now regard as significant turn into ghosts\nof the past. He mentioned the great emperors and philosophers\nof old: important, influential people that used to walk the earth but were reduced to\ndust and ashes many years ago. Like the coming and ceasing of leaves, so\ncome and cease the generations of men. We start as a blob of semen, and we draw our\nlast breath before we know it. Everything is temporary, and we\u2019re here\njust for a fleeting moment, especially if we compare our short lifespans to the existence\nof our planet (let alone the universe). As Marcus Aurelius put it, and I quote: Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each\nof us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already or is impossible\nto see. The span we live is small\u2014small as the corner\nof the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed\nfrom mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long\ndead. End quote. For some, the reality of transience may be\na source of suffering. Isn\u2019t it sad that death takes us back so\nshortly after we come into existence? Hence, some people desperately cling to life,\nseek ways to extend it beyond natural proportions, looking for the fountain of eternal youth. All such attempts to go against nature are\nin vain, as we\u2019re given just a limited amount of time here, of which we generally spend\nthe majority in bodily decay. But there\u2019s also a positive side to the\ntransient nature of the universe, which is that because nothing lasts, nothing is worthy\nof worry. As an example, Marcus Aurelius described the\ninsignificance of reputation. He wrote: But look at how soon we\u2019re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it\nall. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us\u2014how capricious\nthey are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes\nplace. The whole earth a point in space\u2014and most\nof it uninhabited. End quote. The more we realize how little and short our\nlives are, the less reason we see to worry about trivialities, and the more we can appreciate\nthe time we have. Moreover, from a Stoic point of view, the\nshortness of life is also a reason not to waste time. Whatever we want to do, now is the moment. (3) Accepting misfortune We could wish and pray for misfortune never\nto occur, but looking at reality, we see that no one escapes the darker sides of existence. Adversity is part of life. If we fight against it, we don\u2019t just experience\nmisfortune itself but also the disappointment of encountering it despite our wish not to. Nevertheless, people are often busy fighting\nfate, trying to fend off the possible bad things that will happen to them. And as soon as we get sick, lose our money,\nor encounter cloudy, rainy weather when we expect sunshine, we moan and complain and\nwish for something better to arrive quickly. Marcus Aurelius renounces this way of approaching\ndestiny. Instead of hoping for a life free of misfortune,\nit\u2019s better to wish ourselves the fortitude to handle adversity. Such an attitude lies at the root of a Stoic\ncore principle named the dichotomy of control: some things are in our control, and others\naren\u2019t. And so, it\u2019s reasonable to focus mainly\non the things in our control. Or, as Marcus Aurelius stated it: \u201cThen\nisn\u2019t it better to do what\u2019s up to you\u2014like a free man\u2014than to be passively controlled\nby what isn\u2019t, like a slave or beggar?\u201d End quote. When you let your happiness depend on outside\ncircumstances, then you let fate control you. Imagine you\u2019re constantly worrying about\nyour partner leaving you. And so, you pray for your partner to stay\nby your side. But, according to Stoic cosmology, whatever\nhappens to you can be attributed to the gods: the source of all things. Things may happen that seem tragic, but according\nto the Stoics, it\u2019s what the gods intended. Therefore, for example, a relationship falling\napart is part of the divine plan, and our prayers won\u2019t stop it from happening. And so, according to Marcus Aurelius, it\u2019s\nbetter to direct our prayers to things we can control. I quote: Start praying like this and you\u2019ll see. Not \u201csome way to sleep with her\u201d\u2014but\na way to stop wanting to. Not \u201csome way to get rid of him\u201d\u2014but\na way to stop trying. Not \u201csome way to save my child\u201d\u2014but\na way to lose your fear. Redirect your prayers like that, and watch\nwhat happens. End quote. We can\u2019t control the actions of a romantic\npartner, but we can work on ourselves, building mental fortitude for enduring a possible breakup. We can\u2019t prevent someone we\u2019re attached\nto from walking out of our lives, but we can develop the power to accept whatever happens\nand even wish for things to happen as they happen. If we accept misfortune, even the gods cannot\nharm us, no matter what they put on the table. (4) Accepting change Nature\u2019s default position is change, as\neverything is born from it, and nothing in the world is static. Not just the universe around us changes; we\nalso change, just looking at the cells in our bodies that constantly renew themselves\nuntil we die. Marcus Aurelius described \u2018change\u2019 as\na natural thing that ultimately benefits the whole. We could compare the changes we see around\nus to our bodies constantly replacing old parts with new ones, which may be unfortunate\nfor the pieces in themselves, but it\u2019s good for the body altogether. In the same way, our environment engages in\nenduring self-maintenance, replacing old with new elements, always seeking the most optimal\ncircumstances. It\u2019s the unfolding of nature\u2019s plan, and\nwe should accept it, according to Marcus Aurelius, as it leads to \u201cthe good health of the world,\nand the well-being and prosperity of Zeus himself.\u201d As we\u2019ve explored transience earlier, \u2018change\u2019\nis different. Change isn\u2019t just the temporary nature of\nall things, but the entire process of things becoming different. There\u2019s never a fixed state in the universe,\nso the process of change is always at work. Even the most unchanging objects like a calm\nlandscape or rock steadily resting in the surf are changing, even though less visibly\nthan, let\u2019s say, our lips when talking or someone\u2019s posture when running. Some living creatures come into existence\nand die within twenty-four hours, like the mayfly. Others live for more than 10,000 years, like\nthe glass sponge, and many planets survive billions of years. But none of these things are eternal; as change\ngives birth to them, it will also destroy them. Without change, our world wouldn\u2019t exist,\nand life wouldn\u2019t be possible. As Marcus Aurelius stated: \u201cThe world is\nnothing but change.\u201d End quote. But, ironically, even though we\u2019re born\nout of change, we fear change at the same time. Many people cling to situations, objects,\npeople, and ideas, wishing they\u2019d never change; always stay the same. But the change they so intensely fear is already\nin progress, and the moment of witnessing these alterations with the bare eye is just\na matter of time. When the sun shines, a storm is on its way;\nwhen it\u2019s summer, the fall is already knocking on its door. Trying to maintain the status quo is like\ngrasping water, expecting it never to flow out of your hands. I quote: Some things are rushing into existence, others\nout of it. Some of what now exists is already gone. Change and flux constantly remake the world,\njust as the incessant progression of time remakes eternity. We find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us should we value\nwhen none of them can offer a firm foothold? Like an attachment to a sparrow: we glimpse\nit and it\u2019s gone. End quote. (5) Accepting your nature Many people have difficulties accepting their\nnatural attributes, like their appearance, physical weaknesses, and even the unavoidable\nfate of aging and death. But Marcus Aurelius encouraged himself to\naccept the limits placed on his body and be content with his days. He also told himself to remember the nature\nof the world, his nature, how he relates to the world, and that he\u2019s part of nature\nand supposed to live in harmony with it. Some people have more athletic bodies; others\nhave greater intellects. There are ways to change ourselves to some\nextent, but we\u2019re ultimately confined to our natural limits. So, we can spend our lives focusing on our\nweaknesses, trying to achieve things we\u2019re not naturally inclined to acquire. Or, we can embrace our strengths and do what\nwe\u2019re inherently good at. The Stoics emphasized that a unique feature\nof human nature is our faculty of reason. Unlike any other sentient being on Earth,\nhumans can think rationally. Our rational faculty enables us to transcend\nour brute, animalistic nature. So, instead of being servants to our passions,\nwe have the power to override them with reason. Marcus Aurelius provides an example of how\nhe used reason to accept the world around him, good and bad, despite his more animalistic\nnature telling him otherwise. I quote: People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things\nthat happen to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each thing as it deserves. End quote. Humans can choose such an attitude thanks\nto the ability to reason. Our nature allows us to bypass our animalistic\nurges and follow a wiser path. Instead of blindly following our desires,\nwe can identify these tendencies and comprehend how they can be a source of misery. And instead of being slaves to our desires\nand aversions, we can see how fighting fate only causes us distress. And so, based on our understanding of how\nthings work, we may conclude that accepting external circumstances (things we cannot change),\nno matter how unpleasant, is a rational decision.
